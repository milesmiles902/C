Commands: nano "README.md"
          git add .
          git commit -m "Update: markdown"
          git push origin <new_branch>

A github README.md informs others about the repository and important inner-pieces. 

nano "README,md"
Notes: The repository has an optional feature for a text file in the top level directory. The file explains the project with a heading or list. Simple features include words about repository heirarchy, links, changes, or compliation. Advanced features in the Markdown language are: Headers, Nested Lists, Images, and Citations. A helpful tip is a "README.md" in each folder where applicable. Sequential addition (git add .), commit (git commit -m "Update: markdown") and push command (git push origin <new_branch>) finalize the lesson.
