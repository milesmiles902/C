//Problem #2: The Queue ADT that was implemented with a list would have a similar Big-O performance.
//Problem #3: A result of reversing the linked list add method is different for an ordered and unordered type. The ordered list has checks-and-balances to prevent error, which the unordered list would flag an error.
//Problem #4: The remove method works by adjusting the previous, current, and head node's data entries. 
//Problem #5: When there is only an item in the remove method, an unordered list flags when the items is found, then adjusts the head, and previous nodes according to the current node's data entries.
