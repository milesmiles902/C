This is fairly straightforward, portable Common Lisp code. No additional libraries are necessary.
The code has been tested on several Common Lisp implementations, but for benchmarking this particular
code, SBCL is recommended. There is a shell script that shows how to invoke SBCL to run this code.

If SBCL is not available in your package manager, you can download a binary from http://sbcl.org/platform-table.html
