Question 7.5.6 (Coordinate Ascent for Problems with Special Structure):

Dual Problem: q(mu) = Q(mu) + sum_j=1_r[q_j(mu_j)]

Constraint: mu_j >= 0

Lemma: A Coordinate Descent method with Line Minimization is lower or equal to the original iteration.

Proof by Deduction:

  Hypothesis:

    Coordinate Descent with Line Minimization: 

    q(mu,d^k) = Q(mu) + sum_j=1_r[q_j(mu_j) + d^k*mu_j]

  Outcome:

    q(mu,d^k) <= q(mu)
  
Rule: Line Minimization Rule:         |    0     |
                                      |    .     |
                                      |    0     |
                              d^k = - |df(x^k)/dx|
                                      |    0     |
                                      |    .     |
                                      |    0     |
