Question 5.1.5:

Function: min{ f(x,eta)}

Constraint: Ax=b

Sequence: eta^{k+1} = (1-theta)eta^k  
              theta = 1/(6*sqrt(n)


Lagrangian or penal function: f(x,eta) = <c,x>-eta*sum_1_n [log(x)]

                                       = cx-eta*n

A move left-and-right in the Lagrangian solves the second equation in the problem: cx-f(x,eta) = -eta*n

                                                                                               = e^-r  as listed r = -ln(eta*n)
                                                                                               
                                                                                               <= (3/2)e^-r

The first equation requires a substration about r and r^0: r-r^0 >= -ln(n*eta^k)+ln(n*eta^0)

                                                                 >= -ln(1-1/(6sqrt(n)))

                                                                 >= 0 at large n

The remainder r-r^0 >= 0 satisfies the books advice, "k be the smallest integer such that..."

Therefore,     r-r^0 >= 0

                     >= k

And!  (r-r^0)sqrt(n) >= k

The proposition relates to the paper Tseng, 1989. It is also much of the chapter.

Rules: Proposition 5.1.4:
         When x>0 and Ax=b, and that ||q(x,eta)||>=gamma for some gamma
         A d in the set (0,sqrt(n))
         While eta = (1-d/sqrt(n))*eta
         ||q(x,eta)|| >= (gamma*gamma+d) / (1-d/sqrt(n))
         Especially when d <= gamma(1-gamma)/(1+gamma)
