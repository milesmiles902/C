Question 2.5.4:

Mapped Set: H_i(x,y) <= H_i(xbar,u) for all u with x <= xbar

Function: f_i(x) = min H(x,u)

          F(x) = (f_1, f_2, ..., f_n)

Weighted sup-norm: |H_i(x,u)-H_i(xbar,u)|/eta <= ||x-xbar||

Again, if the inequality becomes exact:

       H_i(x,y) = H_i(xbar,u)

       |H_i(x,u)-H_i(xbar,u)|/eta <= ||x-xbar||

                                   = 0

Both conditions in Proposition 2.5.1 are satisfied for every initial condition's convergence.

Rules: Totally Asynchronous Fixed Point Iteration:
         x^{k+1} = F_i(x1^k,...,xm^k)
         x^{k+1} = {F_i(x1^tau,...,xm^tau)    k is real
                   {x_i^k                     k is not real

       Proposition 2.5.1:
         S(k+1) is a subset of S(k)
         1) Synchronous Convergence Conditions:
              F(x) is an element of S(k+1)
         2) Box Condition:
              S(k) = S1(k) x .... x S_m(k)
         Then every initial condition converges
