Question 2.4.7:

Function: f is a quadratic with eigenvalues within an interval [a,b] where a > 0.

Constraint: ||delf_k(x^k)|| < error ; The absolute change is less than a threshold.

The quadratic function symbolized by a cost function is many formula with polynomial order greater than two. A verbal slang:
       
       f(x) = (1/2)*x'*Q*x+b*x

A derivative about the cost function:
 
       delf(x) = x'*Q + b
 
               = 0

            x* = b/Q
      
When the steps approach x*:

       x^{k+1} - x* = x^{k} - alpha^k*delf_k(x^k) - x* 
                    
                    = x^{k} - alpha^k*(x'Q+b) - x* - alpha^k*delf_k(x*)
 
                    = x^{k} - alpha^k*x'Q + alpha^k*Q*x* - x* - alpha^k*delf_k(x*)
            
                    = (1-alpha^k*Q)(x^{k}-x*) - alpha^k*delf_k(x*)  <------The last term is zero because the derivative at the minimum.

Proposition 1.2.3 - Diminishing Stepsize proposed a derivative convergence less than 2*error divided by a lower bound. The derivative-error relationship is a threshold for iterative methods. 

        lim(k->inf) ||x^k-x*|| <= 2*error/gamma;

        lim(k->inf) ||x^{k+1}-x*|| <= 2*error/gamma
                     

Rules: Gradient Method:
         x^{k+1} = x^k-alpha*delf_k(x^k)

       Prop 1.2.3: Diminishing Stepsize
         x^{k+1} = x^k + alpha^k*d^k
         c||delf(x^k)||^2 <= -delf(x^k)'*d^k
         ||d^k||^2 <= c||delf(x^k)||^2
         If alpha^k->0, sum_0_inf [alpha^k] = inf
         then, f(x^k)->-inf or f(x^k) converges to a finite value and delf(x^k)->0
         Also, x^k is a stationary point of f
