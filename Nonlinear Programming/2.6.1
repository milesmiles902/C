Question 2.6.1

Cost Function: f(x,u) = x^2+sum_0_{N-1} [u^2]

Scalar System x_{i+1} = a*x_i+u_i

Partial Conjugate Gradients limit the number of iterations well below infinity. The guideline is a maximum number of cycles at zero curvature in the cost function. 

A model into the system's eigenvalues, Bertesekes (1974):

      h(x,u) = x^2
      
          x* = 0;
 

      G(u) = sum_0_{N-1} [u^2]

      max[x'*d/dx[dG/dx(x*)]*x / x*S^-1*x

             = 2*x'*x/x*x

             = 2

The model presents a solution where control sequence's optimal number of cycles is two.
