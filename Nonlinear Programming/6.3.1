Question 6.3.1:

A geometric multiplier from Definition 5.1.1 has mu* = (mu1,...,mur).

The Lagrangian for Definition 5.1.1: 

       L(x,mu) = f(x)+sum_1_r[mu_i*g(x_i)]

A minimum for the Lagrangian in the above line:

       L(x*,mu*) = f(x*)+sum_1_r[mu_i*g(x_i*)]

       L(x*,mu*) - f(x*) = sum_1_r[mu_i*g(x_i*)]

       [L(x*,mu*) - f(x*)]/sum_1_r[g(x_i*)] = sum_1_r[mu_i]

The left-hand side in the prior line needs a positive sign because Definition 5.1.1. The negative numerator requires a negative denominator, as a proof for the problem and Definition 5.1.1.

A converse argument is also true with the geometric multiplier: mu = (mu1, gamma). The zero dual gap between the original vector (mu1,...,mu2) and (mu1,gamma) enables sign comparisons. Specifically, gamma>=0 an gamma*g(x)>=0.

From the Lagrangian already written:

       L(x,mu) = f(x) + sum_1_r[mu_i*g(x_i)]

               = f(x) + mu1*g(x) + gamma*sum_1_r[g(x_i)]

Minimums for the new Lagrangian follow:

       [L(x*,mu*) - f(x*)]/(mu1*g(x) + gamma*sum_1_r[g(x_i)]) = sum_1_r[mu_i]

Where the denominator's positive sign is informally a must.
              
Rules: Equation 6.29:
         minimize f(x)
         subject to x in set X
                    g(x)<=0 for j=1,...,r
      
       Proposition 6.3.1 (Convexity and Interior Point):
         When a feasible and optimal f* is finite.
         In a convex subset over X
         There is a vector such that g(x)<0

       Definition 5.1.1:
         A vector mu* = (mu1*,...,mur*) is the geometric multiplier
         When mu>=0 and f*=L(x,mu*)
