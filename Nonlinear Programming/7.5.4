Question 7.5.4 (A Variation of the Subgradient Method)

Subgradient Method: mu^{k+1} = [mu^k + (s*d)^k]+
 
                               where d^k = |g^k                  if k=0
                                           |g^k+beta^k**d^{k-1}  if k>0

Bounds: 0 < s^k < [q(mu*)-q(mu^k)]/||d^k||^2

        beta^k = |-gamma*g^k*d^{k-1}/||d^{k-1}||^2               if g^k*d^{k-1} < 0
                 | 0                                             otherwise


Lemma: (mu*-mu^k)*d^k/||d^k|| >= (mu*-mu^k)*g^k/||g^k||

Proof by Equivalence (Three step):

     First Step:  Hypothesis: (mu*-mu^{k+1})*d^{k+1} = (mu*-mu^{k+1})*g^{k+1} + beta^k*mu*-mu^{k+1})*d^k

                  Outcome: (mu*-mu^{k+1})*d^{k+1} >= (mu*-mu^{k+1})*g^{k+1}

     Second Step: Hypothesis: ||mu^{k+1} - mu*|| < ||mu^k+(s*d)^k - mu*||^2

                  Outcome: ||mu^{k+1} - mu*|| < ||mu^k-mu*||
 
     Third Step:  Hypothesis: ||d^k||^2 - ||g^k||^2 = ||g^k+beta^k*d^{k-1}||^2 - ||g^k||^2 

                                                    <= 0

                  Outcome: (mu*-mu^k)*d^k/||d^k|| >= (mu*-mu^k)g^k/||g^k||

Note: Proofs in past papers either wrote about the steps in alphanumeric or supplemental pages. A basic review about criteria or rubriks helped, again, more symbols in universal advice. 

Sidenote: What's the binomial derivative?

Sidenote #2: A thought while shoveling compost, a binomial function describes an action about one, or thousands of objects (e.g. a thousand coins on the ground, a thousand bees in sight, or one coin on the ground). Much like velocity, binomials have a direction and magnitude, also both about a present action.
