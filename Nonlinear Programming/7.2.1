Question 7.2.1 (Line Search in Dual Ascent Methods):

Function: min f(x)

Dual Function: q(lambda)

Stepsize: alpha* = argmax{q(lambda+alpha*d}

The geometric multiplier for the single-constraint problem below has a line search constant from the previous line.

Function: f(x) + lambda*A*x

Constraint: d(Ax-b) <= 0

The relationship between the function and dual function is a Lagrangian in the form:

  L(x,lambda) = f(x) + lambda*(Ax-b)
 
              = q(lambda)

A linear search modification minimizes the dual function:

  q(lambda+alpha*d) <= q(lambda) + alpha*d

  argmax{q(lambda+alpha*d)} = alpha*

Notes: #1 - The geometric multiplier has a variation with step-wise lambda. Another proof exists.
       #2 - General line-by-line solutions follow which basic proof? The lemma, proof, lemma, and proof is the next practice.
