Question 1.4.8

Function: f(x) = ||x||^beta        

          where beta > 1

a) A value of x^0 = 0 substitutes for an initial condition. The function converges to an optimal solution whenever beta is even. The initial condition is more important when beta is odd. In all situations, Armijo's rule thresholds the convergence when satisfactory or between local minima. 

b) The function never converges by Newton's Method when beta <= 1. 

Rules: Newton's Method:
        x^{k+1} = x^k - delf(X)/del[delf(x)]

       Armijo Rule (Successive reduction rule)
        f(x^k)-f(x^k+(b^m)*s*(d^k))>=-sigma*(b^m)*s*delf(x*)'*(d^k)
        Reduction factor: b
        Step sizes: (b^m)*s
        Scaling factor: (d^k)
        Trials: m
        Change of the Quadratic Interpolation: delf(x*)'*(d^k)
