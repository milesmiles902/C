Question 6.4.8:

Function: Ax-b

Constraint x

Problem 6.4.7 is akin to 6.4.8 when b = -g and A=F.for the below function and constraint.

  Function: b*z

  Constraint: A*z<=0

The complex l_inf approximation:

  Function: (sum_1_inf((b*z)^inf))^1/inf

  Constraint: (sum_1_inf((A*z)^inf))^(1/inf) <=0
