Question 1.3.1

Function: f(x,y) = x^2 + 1.999*x*y+y^2

The rate of convergence for f(x,y) is:

      f(x^{k+1},y^{k+1})/f(x^k,y^k) = ((M-m)/(M+m))^2

A solution for the eigenvalues, m and M:

      Q = (2-lambda)*(2-lambda)-(1.999)(1.999)

      m = 0.001, and M = 3.999

A solution with eigenvalue ratios:
 
     f(x^{k+1},y^{k+1})/f(x^k,y^k) = ((3.999-0.001)/(3.999+0.001))^2

                                   = 0.9990001250

The steepest descent has a large ratio of eigenvalues, condition number, and a slow convergence across the function-space.

Rule: Line Minimization Rule: 
      ||x^{k+1}||/||x^k|| <= max{|1-alpha^k*m|, |1-alpha^k*M|}
      where alpha^k = 2/(M+m)
      ||x^{k+1}||/||x^k|| <= (M-m)/(M+m)
      f(x^{k+1})/f(x^k) <= ((M-m)/(M+m))^2
