Question 6.1.6:

Function sum_1_{N-1} [u_i]^2

Constraint: x_{i+1} = A_i*x_i+B_i*u_i
            
            given x0, and x>=c

The dual problem has the form when d = (A_i/B_i)*(x_i)/(x_{i+1}), c=0, because similar minimums in the function and constraint.

Function: mu*Q*mu + mu*d

Constraint: mu >= 0
