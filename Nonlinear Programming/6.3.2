Question 6.3.2 (Optimality Conditions for Nonconvex Cost):

Function: f(x)

Constraint: x in set X
            g(x)<=0
            f is continously differentiable
            X is a subset in the Reals as a clossed convex set
            Where x* is the minimum

a) x* = argmin{L(x,mu*)}
      
      = argmin{delf(x) + sum_1_r[mu_i**g(x_i)]}

      = argmin{delf(x)'*x + sum_1_r[mu_i**g(x_i)]}

b) x* = argmin{L(x,mu*)}

      = argmin{dL(x,mu*)/dx * x}
 
      = argmin{delL(x,mu*)' * x}
