Question 1.3.6 (Convergence Rate Characterizations)

a) {e^k} converges by a limit (k->inf) faster than linearly with convergence ratio beta

       lim(k->inf) e^k = infinity, but the lim(k->inf) sup(e^k)^{1/k} = e_lower_limit <= beta <= q*{1/k}*beta

   {e^k} converges by a limit (k->inf) slower than linearly with convergence ratio beta

       lim(k->inf) e^k = infinity, but the lim(k->inf) inf(e^k)^{1/k} = e_upper_bound >= q^{1/k}*beta >= beta

   {e^k} converges by limit (k->inf) equal to linearlu with convergence ratio beta

       lim(k->inf) e^k = infinity, but lim(k->inf) (e^k)^{1/k} = e = q^{1/k}*beta = beta

b) If e^k != 0 for all k, and beta1 = lim(k->inf) inf[e^{k+1}/e^k], also beta2 = sup[e^{k+1}/e^k]

   If 0 < beta1 <= beta2 < 1, then {e^k} converges as:
 
       0 < lim(k->inf) inf[e^{k+1}/e^k] <= lim(k->inf) sup[e^{k+1}/e^k] < 1

       0 < e_lower_bound <= e_upper_bound < 1

   If beta1 = beta2 = 0, the convergence is superlinear.

Conditions: Converges faster than linearly with convergence ratio beta: e^k <= q*beta^k
  
            Converges slower than linearly with convergence ratio beta: q*beta^k <= e^k

            Converges linearly with convergence ratio beta: e^k = q*beta^k

            Limit Inferior: lim[inf(X)] or _lim_ X
  
            Limit Superior: lim[sup(X)] or -lim- X

            lim[inf(X)] <= lim[sup(X)], the lower and upper bounds of an oscillating limit at infinity
