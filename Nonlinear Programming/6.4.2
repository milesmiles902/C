Quetion 6.4.2:

Function: sum_1_n[f(x_i)]

Constraint: x in set M
            where M = xbar+S
                  xbar = vector
                  S = subspace

The book wants an origin translation in the dual problem. A horizontal translation shifts x in f(x), while vertical shift f(x) by an additional term. An answer about which shift is unclear. A vertical shift was the choice because the book's other dual problems.

The Monotropic programming problem function becomes sum_1_n[f(x_i)] - xbar with a constraint x-xbar = S.
