Question 6.3.5 (Directional Convexity):

Function: f(x,u)

Constraint: h(x,u) = 0


Lagrangian: 

	L(x,u) = f(x,u) + lambda*h(x,u)

Minimal Lagrangian: 

	L(x*,u*) = f*

                 = inf{f(x,u)+lambda*h(x,u)}

Minimal u*: 
	
	L(x*,u) = u* 
 
                = inf{f(x*,u) + lambda*h(x*,u)}

The Lagrangian equation is also: 

	delL(x,u) = delf(x*,u*) + lambda*delh(x*,u*)

                  = 0

Rules: Proposition 6.3.1 (Convexity and Interior Point):
         When a feasible and optimal f* is finite.
         In a convex subset over X
         There is a vector such that g(x)<0
