Question 6.5.8 (Birkhoff's Theorem for Doubly Stochastic Matrices):

Polyhedral Set: S = {x in X | x_ij>=0, sum_j=1_n[x_ij], sum_i=1_n[x_ij]}

a) The extreme points in S are a permutation matrix
   
   sum_i=1_n[S_ij] = 1 
  
   sum_j=1_n[S_ij] = 1

b) The matrix S is totally unimodular.

   P = { x | E*x = d, b<x<c } models S = { x | sum_j=1_n[x_ij] = 1, 0<=x<=inf}

c) Every doubly stochastic matrix X writes as sum_1_k[gamma*X_ij] 

   sum_1_k[gamma*X_ij] = sum_1_j[gamma]*sum_1_j[X_ij]

                         wheen sum_1_j[gamma] = 1

Rules: Doubly Stochastic:
         A matrix with row or column sums to one
 
       Permutation Matrix:
         A matrix with only one or zero
