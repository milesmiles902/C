Question 5.3.4:

Inequality Constrained Problem :               Nondifferentiable Penalty Function:

  Function: f(x)                               Function: f(x) + c*P(x)

  Constraint g(x) <= 0                         Constraint: x is real

When P(X) = max{g0(x), g1(x),...,gr(x)}

The solution (x*,mu*) in Inequality Constrained Problems is the solution for Nondifferentiable Penalty functions. Specifically, the Lagrangian maximum or minimum equate, and also x*, such as: max{ L(x,c) }=max{ L(x,mu) } = max{f(x)+c*g(x)}=max{f(x)+c*P(x)}.

Rules: Proposition 4.3.1:
         f(x*) is a local minimum
         When unique multipliers prevail
         Then dL(x*,lambda*,mu*)/dx = 0
              mu>=0
         Also, ydel[dL(x*,lambda*,mu*)/dx]y>=0
         Then also, for all y, delh(x*)y=0 and delg(x*)y = 0
