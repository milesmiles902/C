Question 1.2.7

Function: I = current between A and B relates to two variable resistors: 0 <= x1 <= R1 , 0 <= x2 <= R2
 
Step #1: She fixes x2 and finds I* with x1

Step #2: She fixes x1 and finds I* with x2

She knows 0 <= x1 <= R1 and 0 <= x2 <= R2

The steepest descent method helps the electrical engineer because the current (I), depends on two-dimensions, x1 and x2. Her method fixed a constant resistance, then modified the second resistance. This method is steps for: a partial derivative, a multi-dimensional gradient, or steepest decent method with constant stepsize. 

Rule: Steepest Descent Method:                                                                                              D^k=1, k=0,1,...,                                                                                                    Normalized Negative Gradient: d^k=-delf(x*)/||delf(x^k)||                                                            Iteration: x^{k+1} = x^k-alpha*(D^k)*delf(x^k) where d^k=-D^k*del(f^k)
