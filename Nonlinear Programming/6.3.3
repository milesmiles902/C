Question 6.3.3 (Boundedness of the Set of Lagrange Multipliers for Nonconvex Constraints):

Function: f(x)

Constraint: x in set X
            g(x)<=0

Local Minimum: x* = argmin{delL(x*,mu)*x}

The set mu*=M* is nonempty with a bound as a proven in Problem 6.3.1 and 6.3.2, 

  Lagrangian: L(x,mu) = L(x,M) = f(x) + sum_1_r[M*g(x_i)]

  A minimal Lagrangian: L(x,M*) = f(x) + sum_1_r[M*g(x_i)]

  The right-hand side in the equation below must be positive, in addition to the left. So, the denominator is negative on the left.

        [L(x*,mu*) - f(x*)]/(mu1*g(x) + gamma*sum_1_r[g(x_i)]) = sum_1_r[mu_i]

Proposition 4.3.12 needs a negative c*y <=0. In this setup,  g(x*)*d <= 0.

Rules: Proposition 4.3.12 (Farkas Lemma):
         c*y<=0 for all y such that ay<=0
         If and only if there exists nonegative scalars such that c=mu_1*a_1+...+mu_r*a_r
