Question 4.3.7:

The condition, mu>0 in Proposition 4.3.2 appears as greater than (or equal to) with similar outcomes. The Lagrange equation still equates to zero, the second derivates too, whatever case the previous condition.

Rules: Proposition 4.3.2 (Second Order Sufficiency Conditions):
         When everything is real,
           dL(x*,lambda*,mu*)/dx = 0
           h(x*) = 0
           g(x*) <= 0
           mu >= 0
           ydel[dL(x*,lambda*,mu*)/dx]y>0
