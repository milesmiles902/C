Question 3.2.8 (A Variation of the Simplicial Decomposition Method):

Closed Set: X^k = {x| x=beta*x0 + sum_0_k[gamma_i*xbar^i], beta>=0, beta + sum_0_k[gamma_i=1]}

Armijo's Rule prepares an upper limit and an argument for a stationary point within bounds through a scalar in the step-size:

       f(x^k)-f(x^{k+1}) = f(x^k)-f(x^k+alpha^k*d^k)
  
                         >= f(x^k)-f(x^k+(b^m)*s*(d^k))

Proposition 1.2.1 and 3.2.1 utilize a gradient descent and an upper limit about stepsize.

Rules: Armijo Rule (Successive reduction rule)
       f(x^k)-f(x^k+(b^m)*s*(d^k))>=-sigma*(b^m)*s*delf(x*)'*(d^k)
       Reduction factor: b
       Step sizes: (b^m)*s
       Scaling factor: (d^k)
       Trials: m
       Change of the Quadratic Interpolation: delf(x*)'*(d^k)

       Prop 1.2.1 (Stationarity of Limit Points for Gradient Methods)
         If x^k, then x^{k+1} = x^k + alpha^k*d^k 
         where alpha^k = Armijo's rule, and d^k = gradient descent
         lim(k->inf) x^k = Stationary Point
 
       Proposition 3.2.1: (Stationary of Limit Points for Feasible Direction Methods)
         x^{k+1}=x^k+alpha^k*d^k
         If d^k is a gradient and alpha^k by limited minimization rule, then x^k stationary
