Question 4.4.4 (Duality for Transportation Problems):

Sets: X = {x| sum_1_n[x]=1, x>=0, i=1,...,m}
      
      Z = {z| sum_1_n[z]=1, z>=0, j=1,...,m}

Linear programming duality shown for: max_z{min_x{xAz}} = min_x{ max_z{xAz}}

      max_z{min_x{xAz}} = max_z{Az}

                        = A

      max_x{min_z{xAz}} = max_x{xA}

                        = A

      Clairaut's Theorem is the partial derivatives representation for linear programming duality. Also, the classical saddle point theorem.
