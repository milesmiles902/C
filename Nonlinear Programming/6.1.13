Question 6.1.13 (Shapley-Folkman Theorem):

Function: y_i = sum_j=1_j=t [a_ij * y_ij]

Constraint: a_ij > 0

            sum[a_ij] = 1

Vector set:    z = (x   ,1,1,...,1)
 
            z_ij = (y_ij,1,0,...,0)

            z_mj = (y_mj,0,0,...,1)

Alternative vector set: z = sum_1_m [ sum_1_n[ a_ij * z_ij ]]

With Caratheodory's Theorem, a summation decomposes into other summations.

       z = sum_1_m [ sum_1_n[ a_ij * z_ij ]]

         = sum_1_m [ sum_1_n[ b_ij * z_ij ]]

         where sum[b_ij] = 1

This idea associates decompositions in linear algebra, basis sets and wavefunctions in quantum mechanics, also, statistical summands.

Other summands in the problem include the original function, y_i.

Rules: Caratheodory's Theorem:
         a) Every nonzero vector from cone(X) is a representation of linearly independent vectors from X
         b) Every vector from cone(X) represents a convex combination of no more than n+1 vectors from X
