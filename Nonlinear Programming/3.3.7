Question 3.3.7:

Proposition 3.3.2 replacement:

  i)  ||delf(x)-delf(y)|| <= L||x-y||, ∀ x,y ∈ A

  ii) {x ∈ X | f(x) <= c} is bounded for every c ∈ R

An equation from the book two lines below the proposition written:

  f(x^{k+1}) - f(x^k) <= (L/2-1/s)||xbar^k-x^k||^2

                      <= f(x^k)

A perspective about the maximum and lower bounds of s show bound:

  Case 1: s = 0

       f(x^{k+1}) - f(x^k) <= infinity

  Case 2: s = 2/L

       f(x^{k+1}) - f(x^k) <= 0 and stationary

In-between the inequality a stepsize evaluates:

  f(x^{k+1}) - f(x^k) <= (L/2-1/s)*||xbar^k-x^k||^2 
                      
                      <= -(1/s)*||xbar^k-x^k||^2 + (L/2)*||xbar^k-x^k||^2

                      <= f(x^k)*||xbar^k-x^k||^2 + (L/2)*||xbar^k-x^k||^2

Where the step-by-step change in the left term:

       f(x^k)*||xbar^k-x^k||^2 <= -(1/s)*||xbar^k-x^k||^2

The left side is a constant (c) at a stationary point, so the replacement ii) too.

Rules: Proposition 3.3.2 (Lipschitz condition): 
         If alpha^k=1 and s^k=s for all k
         For L>0, ||delf(x)-delf(y)|| <= L||x-y||, ∀ x,y ∈ X
         Then, if 0<s<2/L, the set {x^k} is stationary
