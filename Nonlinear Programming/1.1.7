Question 1.1.7

Non-normalized Equation of a Plane: A(x-x0)+B(y-y0)+C(z-z0) = d

Normalized Equation of a Plane: A/d(x-x0)+B/d(y-y0)+C/d(z-z0) = 1

Torricelli Point: F = min {|A-f| + |B-f| + |C-f|}
  
Global Minima Vector: dF/df = (f-A)/|A-f| + (f-B)/|B-f| + (f-C)/|C-f|
                     = 0
                   f = No real solution solving global minima

Other folks challenged minimization by perimeter, angle, or Lagrange multiplier functions.

                   Perimeter #1 = |PA| + |PB| + |PC| = |AP| + |PQ| + |QD|
                   Perimeter #2 = |AD|, which has points PQ between A and D
                   Perimeter #2 < Perimeter #1, which implies a Fermat point with first isogonic centers (120 degrees).
