Question 2.3.3

Function: f is convex

Two cases:

  f(x_max) decreases in Step #2 when replaced by f(x_new)
 
  f(x^i) = f(x_max) decreases vertices one because of x^i != x_max. Every iteration lowers f(x^i) and f(x_max).

Step #1 (Reflection)
  
  x_ref = 2x' - x_max

  I) (x_ref has min cost)
 
      If f(x_min) > f(x_ref), enter step #2

  II) (x_ref has intermediate cost)

      If max{f(x^i) | x^i != x_max} > f(x_ref) >= f(x_min), enter step #3      

  III) (x_ref has max cost)

      If f(x_ref) >= max {f(x^i) | x^i ~= x_max}, enter step #4

Step #2 (Attempt Expansion)
 
      x_exp = 2*x_ref - x'

      x_new = {x_exp if f(x_exp) < f(x_ref)
              {x_ref otherwise

      Upon x_max replacement with x_new

Step #3 (Use Reflection)

      x_new = x_ref forming a new simplex

Step #4 (Perform Contraction)

      x_new = { (1/2)*(x_max+x') if f(x_max) <= f(x_ref)
              { (1/2)*(x_ref+x'), otherwise



Rules: Nelder-Mead Simplex Method
         1. Reflection (min, intermediate and max cost)
         2. Attempt Expansion
         3. Use Reflection
         4. Perform Contraction
