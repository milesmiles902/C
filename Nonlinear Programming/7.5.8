Question 7.5.8 (Approximate Subgradient Method):

Dual Function: q(mu) >= -inf

Constraint: mu is Real

Subgradient Method: mu^{k+1} = [mu^k + (q(mu*) -q(mu^k))*g^k/||g^k||^2]+

Lemma: ||mu^{k+1} - mu*|| < ||mu^k-mu*|| 

Proof by Equivalence:

  Proof #1 by Deduction:

    Hypothesis: ||mu^k + (s*g)^k - mu*||^2  <= ||mu^k-mu*||^2 - 2*s^k*(mu*-mu^k)*g^k + (s^k)^2*||g^k||^2

    Outcome:    ||mu^k + (s*g)^k - mu*||^2  <= ||mu^k-mu*||^2 - (gamma^k(2-gamma^k)*(q(mu*)-q(mu^k))^2)/||g^k||^2

  Proof #2 by Deduction:
 
    Hypothesis: 0 < gamma^k < 2

    Outcome: ||mu^k + (s*g)^k - mu*||^2 <= ||mu^k-mu*||^2

               ||mu^k + (s*g)^k - mu*|| <= ||mu^k-mu*||

                      ||mu^{k+1}- mu*|| <= ||mu^k-mu*||
