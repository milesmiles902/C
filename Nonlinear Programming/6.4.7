Question 6.4.7 (Minimizing the Sum or the Maximum of Norms)

            Equation #1             Equation #2
Function:  sum_1_p [Fx+g]           max [Fx+g]
Constraint:      x                      x

Equation #1's dual problem:

  Step #1: Constraint transplant
 
           Function: g
           Constraint: F*x <= 0

  Step #2: Multiplier (z)

           Function: g*z
           Constraint: F*x*z <= 0

  Step #3: Simplify 

           Function: -g*z
           Constraint: F*z <= 0

The steps above involved an add and subtract with similar terms. 

Equation #1's cone problem: C = {(x,Fx+g)| Fx+g <= 0}

Equation #2's dual problem:

  Step #1: Constraint transplant
 
           Function: max{g}
           Constraint: max{F*x} <= 0

  Step #2: Multiplier (z)

           Function: max{g*z}
           Constraint: max{F*x*z} <= 0

  Step #3: Simplify

           Function: -max{g*z}
           Constraint: max{F*z} <= 0

Equation #2's cone problem: C = {(x,Fx+g} | max{Fx+g} <= 0}

Rules: Second Order Cone Programming Problem
         A cone C = {(x1,...,x2),|xn >= sqrt(x1^2+...+x_{n-1}^2) }
         The dual cone C = {y|0<=y*x}
