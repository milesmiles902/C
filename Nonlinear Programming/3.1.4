Question 3.1.4 (Tartagli'as Problem)

Constraint: 8=x+y; x>=0; y>=0

Function: f(x,y) = x*y*(1-x)

History: Nicols Targalia )1499-1557) studied ballistics, artillary, and projectile motion. Supposedly, he solved the cubic equation in a contest.

A minimal/maximal function given the constraint:

  f(x,y) = x*y*(x-y)

         = x*(8-x)*(x-(8-x))

  df(x,y)/dx = -6x*x+48*x-64

          x* = 4-4/sqrt(3)

The optimal solution inserted into the constraint:

  8 = x + y

  y = 4+4/sqrt(3)
