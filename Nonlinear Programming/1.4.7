Question 1.4.7

Function: Quadratic Cost Function - f(x)= a*x^2

Example of termination: 
  
        1) The derivative, delf(x) = 2*a*x
    
        2) The second derivative del[delf(x)] = 2*a
 
        3) Successive iterations with initial condition x^0=2:
        
           f(x^{k+1}) = f(x^k - delf(x)/del[delf(x)]) 
            
                      = a*(x^k - delf(x)/del[delf(x)])^2 

                      = a*(x^k - x^k))^2

              f(x^1)  = b

The trust region in a simple quadratic cost function has a single eigenvalue and one-step convergence. Extensive quadratic functions with two real (or complex) eigenvalues converge between the respective roots.
                  
Rules: Netwon's Method:
        x^{k+1} = x^k - delf(x)/del[delf(x)]
  
       Trust Region: The region between two eigenvalues.
