Question 3.1.3 (Keplars Planimetric Problem)

Area Circle = pi*r*r ; r=radius

Area of a rectangle = x*y; x=width; y=length;

Constraint: r*r=x*x+y*y

History: Johannes Keplar (1571-1630), German, styled by a neck ruff, frill, and crimped or pleated collar. The style usually worn in the mid-16th century by European and Spanish individuals. Elizabeth. The man discovered a supernove in 1604 and majors laws of planetary motion.

A rectangle constrainted into a circle:

  Area of a rectangle = x*y
  
                      = sqrt(r*r-y*y)*y

The maximal length within the circle:

  dArea/dy = d/dx [sqrt(r*r-y*y)*y]

           = (1/2)*(-2y*y)/sqrt(r*r-y*y)+sqrt(r*r-y*y)

           = 0

        y* = r/sqrt(2)

        r* = sqrt(2)*y

Area of an optimal rectangle shows a square:

   Area = sqrt(r*r-y*y)*y

        = y*y
