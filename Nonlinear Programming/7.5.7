Question 7.5.7 (Solution of Linear Inequalities) 

C = {mu | a_i*mu-b_i >= 0, i=1,...,m}

Algorithm: mu^{k+1} = mu^k = s^k*a_i

Index of Equality: a_i*mu-b_i >= 0

Iterative Coefficient: s^k = (b_i - a_i*b*mu^k)/||a_i||^2

Lagrangian: L(x,mu) = f(x) + mu*g(x)

                    = f(x^k) + mu^k*g(x^k)

Dual Problem:

  Maximize: q(mu)
  
  Subject to: mu

  Function: q(mu) = inf{L(x,mu)} = inf{f(x)+mu*g(x)}


Lemma: The dual problem converges to a point C

Proof by Deduction:

  Hypothesis: lim(k->inf)f(x^k) = 0

  Outcome: lim(k->inf)*inf{L(x,mu)} = lim(k->inf)*inf{f(x^k) + mu^k*g(x^k)}

                                    = lim(k->inf)*inf{mu^k*g(x^k)}

                                    = lim(k->inf)*inf{s^k*a_i*(a_k*mu-b_k)}

                                    = lim(k->inf)*inf{(b_i - a_i*b*mu^k)/||a_i||^2*a_i*(a_k*mu-b_k)}
                                    
                                    = 0

Rules:  Subgradient-Based Optimization Method
          Convex Programming Problem:
            Minimize: f(x)
            Subject to: x
          Dual Problem:
            Maximize: q(mu)
            Subject to: mu
            Function: q(mu) = inf{L(x,mu)} = inf{f(x)+mu*g(x)}
