Question 6.4.1:

Function: sum_1_n[f(x_i)]

Constraint: Ax=b

Monotropic Programming describes a new constraint set e.g. a linear manifold,,duality framework, s;acl varaiable, or interior feasibility.


This is an example with a dual problem:

                         Primal:                            Dual:
Function:             sum_1_n[f(x_i)]                 sum_1_n [g(lambda_i) - b*eta]
 
Constraint:              Ax = b                         lambda = A*eta


In the case, A*x=b
 
             A*x*eta = b*eta
                
As a constraint, Ax*eta-b*eta = 0

An additional zero term from the contraint added to f(x_i) for f(x_i) + Ax*eta-b*eta

If g(lambda_i) = f(x_i)+A*x*eta, then the dual equation appears as sum_1_n [g(lambda_i) - b*eta], further, the constraint adjustment as A*eta = b = lambda.


A Monotropic Programming problem shifts an initial condition, generates a co-dependent term, or aids division by zero in a system of equations.
