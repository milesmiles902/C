Question 6.5.5:

When |sum_#1[e_ij] - sum_#1[e_ij]| <= 1, then the difference between matrices is unimodular because the localized matrices:

    An image:

     sum_[e_ij] = |1 1 0 0|   where sum_#1[e_ij] = |1 1|     and sum_#2[e_ij] = |1 1|
                  |1 1 0 0|                        |1 1|                        |1 1|
                  |0 0 1 1|
                  |0 0 1 1|

     max{sum[eij] - sum_#2[eij]} = +/-1 or 0.

Rules: Unimodular: 
         A square matrix with determinant {-1, 0, 1}. 
         The definition helps matrix inversions because similar values after an inversion.
