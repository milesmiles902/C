Question 2.6.2:

Cost Function: J(u) = [x'*Q*x + sum_0_{N-1}[x'*Q*x + u'*R*u]]/2

System: x_{i+1} = A_i*x_i + B_i*u_i

Constraint: Q=0 for i=0..{N-1}

A simplified cost function:

         J(u) = [x'*Q*x + sum_0_{N-1}[x'*Q*x + u'*R*u]]/2
           
              = sum_0_{N-1}[u*R*u]/2

The maximimum number of iterations is zero or nearby a ratio of total number of iterations. 

Maximum iterations of zero:

         G = 0, because the constraint.

         E = max [x'*d/dx[dG(x*)/dx]*x/x'*S^-1*x]

           = 0 iterations

A ratio of total number of iterations leads to M or m optimal iterations:

         lim (k->inf) sup [J(u^{k+1}{n+1}) - J(u*]] / [J(u^{k*(s+1)})-J(u*)]

                      <= [(M-m)/(M+m)]^2, where k and n are the size of matrix, and allocated total steps

The information in papers show many, many arguments without solutions into number of control sequence cycles, rather, a conjecture why no possible convergence.
