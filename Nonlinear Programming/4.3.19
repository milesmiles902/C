Question 4.3.19 (Boundedness of the Set of Lagrange Multipliers):

Function: f(x)

Constraint: h(x)=0
     
            g(x)<=0

A definition: beta^k = lambda^k/||lambda^k||

              gamma^k = mu^k/||mu^k||

Show this is a nonempty set:

       A nonempty set has a cardinality greater than zero. If coefficient lambda and mu in a Langrange equation are existant, then also the nonempty set. These definitions in the problem provide actual coefficients because the denominator is real.

Show this set has a bound:

       The set's (or function's) upper bound is a real number greater than every element. Lagrangian bounds are the sign of each term's derivative, such that delh(x)*d=0 and delg(x)*d<0 for a given set d. This problems constraints define similar concepts.

Show delg(x*)beta + delg(x*)gamm = 0:

       delg(x*)*beta + delg(x*)*gamm = delg(x*)*lambda^k/||lambda^k|| + delg(x*)*mu^k/||mu^k||

                                     = 0 from the constraints

Show that this is a conradiction of the linear indepdendence/interior point constraint:

       The contradiction is between mu*delg(x*) = 0 and delg(x*)*d < 0. When mu is positive, delg(x*) at zero, the second statement delg(x*)*d never crosses into the negative region.

Rules: Proposition 4.3.8 (Constraint Qualification for an Additional Convex Set Constraint):
         1) There is no nonzero lambda in a Lagrangien when (lambda*delh(x*))(x-x*)>0
         2) There exists a feasible direction such that delh(x*)=0, and delg(x*)*d<0
         3) If so, Fritz John condition holds for an irregular convergence at a minimum in a function
