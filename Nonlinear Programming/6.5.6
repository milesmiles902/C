Question 6.5.6:

Matrix: E = {x| -1,0,1 , colmax(0)<3 }

A Unimodular matrix follows the form:
 
  |sum_#1[e_ij] - sum_#2[e_ij]| <= 1 where e_ij represent a subset in E

Proof by Exhaustion:

            sum_#1[e_ij] Determinant     sum_#2[e_ij] Determinant         Outcome
  Case #1:             0                             0                      0
  Case #2:             0                             1                      1
  Case #3:             1                             0                      1
  Case #4:             1                             1                      0
  Case #5:             0                            -1                      1
  Case #6:            -1                             0                      1
  Case #7:            -1                            -1                      0
  Case #8:            -1                             1                   Not possibly by subset rule          
  Case #9:             1                            -1                   Not possible by subset rule

Rule: Unimodular:
        Subsets exist when:
          1) A column has two nonzero entries
             A) The nonzero entries have same size and unique rows
             B) The nonzero entries have opposite signs, then same subset
