Question 6.4.11:

Function: f(x)

Constraint: g(x) <= 0

This is a rewrite from Paul Tseng at a University of Washington.

Proposition: Functions f(x) and g(x) map the reals from -infinity to infinity as convex, proper, and domain lower semicontinous functions. If so, the primal equation is also domain lower and semicontinous.

Proof: a) x^k is a subsequence that converges toward an average. The lower f(xbar) <= q(x*) and g(xbar)<=0 is feasible for a primal.

       b) x^k is a subsequence that tends toward infinity. A case where f(x) = q(x*) and g(x)<=0 for all sufficiently large iterations is feasible.

       c) x^k is a subsequence that tends toward negative infinity. The general case in proof b.

The proposition implies no duality gap for each case.
