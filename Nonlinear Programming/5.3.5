Question 5.3.5:

Equation 5.103: 

  Function: delf(x^k)*d + (1/2)*d*H*d
  
  Constraint: g(x^k) + delg(x^k)d <= 0

Quadratic Programming (Equation 5.103):          Gradient Descent:

  Function: delf(x^k)*d + (1/2)*d*H*d            Function: x^{k+1} = x^k + alpha^k(xbar^k-x^k)

  Constraint: g(x^k) + delg(x^k)d <= 0           Constraint: xbar^k = [x^k - s^kdelf(x^k)]

  Lagrangian: L(x,c) = f(x)+cP(x)              

The linearization in Quadratic Programming is a Lagrangian:

  L(x,c) = f(x)+c*P(x)

         = delf(x^k)*d + (1/2)*d*H*d + c*(g(x^k) + delg(x^k)d)

         = x^{k+1} - x^k - alpha*(xbar^k-x^k)

         = x^{k+1} - x^k - alpha*(x^k - s^kdelf(x^k) - x^k)
  
         = x^{k+1} - x^k + alpha*(s^k*delf(x^k))

           where d=1, H=0, c=alpha

The Lagrangian solution is from an equation system or through gradient descent.
