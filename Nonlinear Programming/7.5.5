Question 7.5.5:

Function: f(x) = x^2

Constraint: x <= 20

Lagrangian: L(x,mu) = f(x) + mu*g(x)

                        = x^2 + mu*(20-x)

Dual Problem: q(mu) = min{L(x,lambda)}

Iteration #1: mu^0 = 0;

              q(mu^0) + (mu-mu^0)g^0 = x^2 + (mu-mu^0)g^0

                                     = x^2 + mu*(20-x)

                                (x*,mu*) = (20, 40)

Iteration #2: mu^1 = 0

              q(mu^{1}) + (mu-mu^{1})g^{1} = x^2 + (mu-mu^1)g^1

                                           = x^2 + (mu-40)*(20-x)

                                  (x*,mu*) = (20,80)

.....

Rules: Cutting Plane Method:
         When a dual problem:
           Maximize: q(mu)
           Subject to: mu
         The cut plane:
           Maximize: Q^k(mu) = max{q(mu^0) + (mu-mu^0)g^0,...,q(mu^{k-1}) + (mu-mu^{k-1})g^{k-1})
           Subject to mu

Notes: The cutting plane method iterates a coefficient in a tangent line around the function for the minimum or maximum "plane."
