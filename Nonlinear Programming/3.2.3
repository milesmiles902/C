Question 3.2.3:

minimize: f(x) = x1^2+(x2+1)^2

subject to: A) -1 <= x1 <= 1
            B)  0 <= x2
            C)  x* = (0,0)

The solution relates the x1 angle between x2 because their orthogonal axis. 

       f(x^k) - f(x*) = 2*cos(theta)^2 - 1

                      = sin(2*alpha^k)

                      = 1

       f(x^{k+1}) = f(x^k)

       f(x^{k+1}) -f(x*) = 1

       lim(k->inf) [f(x^{k+1}-f(x*)]/[f(x^k)-f(x*)] = 1

Rules: Conditional Gradient Method:
         lim(k->inf) [f(x^{k+1})-f(x*)]/[f(x^k)-f(x*)] = 1
