Question 1.1.3

Domain: f:Rn->R

Function: g(alpha)=f(x*+alpha*d); @minima; alpha = 0

a) delg(alpha)=delf(x*+alpha*d)=delf(x*)=0 @ minima

b) The purpose of the question remains: the input is not always the minimum to an optimization problem when..

Function: f(y,z) = (z-py^2)(z-qy^2)

Conditions: 0<p<q

Global Maximum/Minimum: df(y,z)/dy = -2py*(z-qy^2)+(z-py^2)(-2qy)=0
                                 y = 0
                        
                        df(y,z)/dz = z-qy^2+z-py^2=0;
                                 z = (p+q)*y*y/2
                          
                        (y,z) = 0,0

If, p<m<q, then f(y,my^2)<0, again, an input is not always the minimum to an optimization problem.
