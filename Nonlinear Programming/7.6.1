Question 7.6.1 (Linear Problems with Coupling Variables):

Function: F(x) + sum_1_[pi_j*G_j(z_j)]

Master Problem: F(x) + sum_1_m[H_j(d_j-A_j*x)]

                where H_j(mu_j) = inf pi_j*G_j(z_j)

Dual Equation: q(lambda) = inf{pi_j*G_j(z_j)+lambda_j*B_j*z_j}

The problem from Example 7.2.2 displays Dantzig-Wolfe Decompositions format. Not only with a label, Master Problem, but also by the coupling restraint in the dual equation lambda_j*B_j*z_j.
