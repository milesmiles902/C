Question 2.5.3

Mapped Set: H_i(x,y) <= H_i(xbar,u) for all u with x <= xbar

Function: f_i(x) = min H(x,u)    

          F(x) = (f_1, f_2, ..., f_n)

Vectors: x <= F(x) <= F(xbar) <= xbar

A satisfactory solution requires an exact equality for a true proposition.

       H_i(x,y) = H_i(xbar,u)
 
       x = F(x) = F(xbar) = xbar

The rest fits the rule, decree, guideline, law, order, ruling, test, or precept.

Rules: Totally Asynchronous Fixed Point Iteration: 
         x^{k+1} = F_i(x1^k,...,xm^k)
         x^{k+1} = {F_i(x1^tau,...,xm^tau)    k is real
                   {x_i^k                     k is not real

       Proposition 2.5.1: 
         S(k+1) is a subset of S(k)
         1) Synchronous Convergence Conditions:
              F(x) is an element of S(k+1)
         2) Box Condition:
              S(k) = S1(k) x .... x S_m(k)
         Then every initial condition converges
