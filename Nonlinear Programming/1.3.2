Question 1.3.2

Function: Hessian Q[2x2] = | 1/q_ii    0    |
                           |    0    1/q_ii |


A solution for the eigenvalues, m and M:

      Q = (1/q_11-lambda)*(1/q_ii-lambda)

      m = 1/q_ii, and M = 1/q_ii

The conditional number is one with a fast convergence.

Rule: Line Minimization Rule: 
      ||x^{k+1}||/||x^k|| <= max{|1-alpha^k*m|, |1-alpha^k*M|}
      where alpha^k = 2/(M+m)
      ||x^{k+1}||/||x^k|| <= (M-m)/(M+m)
      f(x^{k+1})/f(x^k) <= ((M-m)/(M+m))^2
