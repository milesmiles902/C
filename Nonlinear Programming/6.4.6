Question 6.4.6 (Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Problems):

Function: x*P*x + 2*q*x + r
Constraint: x*P_i*x + 2*q_i*x + r <= 0 for i=1,..,p

Through completing the square in the function and constraint:

  Function: ||P^{1/2}*x + q/P^{1/2}||^2 + r - q*q/P
  Constraint: ||P^{1/2}*x + q/P^{1/2}||^2 + r - q*q/P < =0

The function becomes the constraint in the Lagrangian and also a cone by an equivalent square root solutiojn:

  Function: x 
  Constraint: ||P^{1/2}*x + q/P^{1/2}|| <= x
              ||P^{1/2}*x + q/P^{1/2}|| <= (q*q/P-r)^{1/2}

Equivalently:

  Function: x
  Constraint: ||Ax+b|| <= x
              ||Ax+b|| <= d

Rules: Second Order Cone Programming Problem
         A cone C = {(x1,...,x2),|xn >= sqrt(x1^2+...+x_{n-1}^2) }
         The dual cone C = {y|0<=y*x}
