Question 6.1.11:

Function: f(x)

Constraint: g(x) <= 0

A duality gap describes the correction factors from additional or consecutive terms. In Geometric multipliers, one, two, or three terms equally fit the systems minimum.

  L(x,mu) = f(x) + mu*g(x) 

          = f(x) + mu1*g(x) + mu2*g(x)

          = f(x) = mu1*g(x) + mu2*g(x) + mu3*g(x)

          where mu = {mu1, mu2} = {mu1, mu2, mu3}
