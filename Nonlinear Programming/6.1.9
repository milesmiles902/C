Question 6.1.9 (Hoffman's Bound):

Function: ||z-x||

Constraint: Ax <= b+y

            where A is an mxn matrix
                  b is a vector

a) Geometric Multipliers are a Lagrangian with more than one weighted term. 

    f(x,y,z) = f(x*,y*,z*) + sum_1_n [mu_i*g_i(x,y)]

             = sum_1_n[mu_i*(Ax-b-y)]

             = mu_i(y,z)*(Ax-b-y) 
 
               when a geometric multiplier represents a function vector

b) f(x,y,z) = mu_i(y,z)*(Ax-b-y) 

          c = mu_i(y,z)
