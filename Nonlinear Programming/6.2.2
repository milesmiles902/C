Question 6.2.2:

With Equation 6.20 having a constraint, ax-b<=0. Proposition 6.2.3 fits a set, P={x|ax<=b, j=1,...,r}

Lagrangian matches the Nonlinear Farkas' Lemma: L(X,mu) = f(x) + mu*g(x)

                                                        = f(x) + mu*(a*X-b)

The cost function matches a polyhedral with a b-bound as in the P set. A supplantation of Proposition 6.2.1 with no duality gaps.

Where the set P = {x|a*x-b<=0, g=r+1,...,p}

Rules: Proposition 6.2.1 (Strong Duality Theorem - Linear Constraints)
         When a cost function is polyhedral and real
         The optimal value is finite
         Also, no duality gaps in geometric multipliers

       Equation 6.20:
         Function: f(x)
         Constraint: x in set X 
                     e*x-d=0
                     a*x-b<=0

       Proposition 6.2.3 (Nonlinear Farkas' Lemma)
         S = {x|ax<=b, j=1,...,r}
         F(x)>=0
         F(x)+sum_1_r[mu*(ax-b)]>=0
