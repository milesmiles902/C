Question 7.5.3 (Convergence Rate of the Subgradient Method)

a) The limit as k approaches infinity is sqrt(k)(q*-q(mu^k)) = 0.

   Proof by Deduction:

     Hypothesis: The sqrt(k)(q*-q(mu^k)) = eta

     Outcome: (q*-q(mu^k)) = eta^2/k

              lim[k->inf](q*-q(mu^k)) = lim[k->inf] eta^2/k

                                      = 0

b) When q(mu*) - q(mu^k) >= a||mu*-mu^k||, then Equation 7.83 becomes Lipschitz bounded.

   Proof by Deduction:

     Hypothesis: ||mu^{k+1} - mu*|| <= ||mu^k-mu*||^2 - (q*-q(mu^k))^2/||g^k||^2

     Outcome: ||mu^{k+1} - mu*|| <= ||mu^k-mu*||^2 - a^2||mu^k-mu*||^2/||g^k||^2

              ||mu^{k+1} - mu*|| <= (1-a^2/b^2)*||mu^k-mu*||^2

                                 <= r*||mu^k-mu*||^2


Rules: Equation 7.83
         ||mu^k + (s*g)^k - mu*||^2 <= ||mu^k-mu*||^2 - (gamma^k(2-gamma^k)*(q(mu*)-q(mu^k))^2)/||g^k||^2
