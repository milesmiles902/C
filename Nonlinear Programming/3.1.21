Question 3.1.21:

Function: f is convex
         
          X is a vector sum of a compact set and closed cone

            = {x| sum_1_n[A_i*x_i]<=0 && A_i>=0 }

Constraint: f* is an optimal value

            Asymptotic direction: {x| f(x) <= gamma^k}

An optimal solution:

       If a set encloses the step or iterative sequence, then an optimal solution too.

       X = {x| x < gamma^k}

       S = {X| f(x) < gamma^k}

         = {X| f(x^k-alpha^k*d) < gamma^k}

       x^k-alpha^k*d in the set of X, so

       x^k-alpha^k*d in the set of S

Rules: Proposition 3.1.2:
         S^k is a sequence
         S^{k+1} is a subset of S^k
         S^k is nonempty
