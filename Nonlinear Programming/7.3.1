Question 7.3.1 (partial Proximal Algorithm):

Function: Q(z) = min {f(x) + 1/(2c)||x-z||^2}

Vector #1: zbar = argmin {f(x) + 1/(2c)*sum_i [x_i-z_i|^2}

Vector Components: zbar_i = |z    i in the set I
                            |zbar i not in the set i

a) Q(z) = min { f(x) + 1/(2c)||x-z||^2 }

       <= min{ sup{f(x) + 1/(2c)||x-z||^2 }}
 
       <= min{ f(x) + 1/(2c)||x-zbar||^2 }

       <= min {phi(x)}

  where zbar = argmin {phi(x)}

             = f(x) + 1/(2c)||x-zbar||^2 

b) phi(zbar) <= f(zbar) <= phi(z) <= f(z)

   The book suggests a lower output by an average independent variable than the function's normal unaveraged independent variable. A speculative truth. Lemma: 10 Basic functions, Proof: Each function attempted by plot. Outcome: A prototype f(x) for the general model not possible for 1/x.

   The f(x)=1/x case demonstrated a badly-behaved argument.

   Other arbitrary cases, uncommon summations and limits such as sum of the natural numbers (e.g. sum_1_infinity [x] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + infinity != infinity).
