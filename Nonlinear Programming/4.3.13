Question 4.3.13 (Fritz John Conditions for Nondifferentiable Cost):

Function: f(x)

Constraint: h(x)=0
            g(x)<=0

a) i) The vector: -sum_1_m[lambda**delh(x*)] - sum_1_r[mu**delg(x*)] is a subgradient because x* in Fritz John's first condition.
   ii) mu not zero works when both -delf(x)*mu>0 and g(x)*mu>0.
   iii) The third line in Proposition 4.3.5 requires at least one coefficient not zero.
   iv) Minimum coefficient "neighborhoods" is the fourth line in Proposition 4.3.5 below.

b) Fritz John conditions apply with mu of one, especially for concave functions because the sign of the second derivative.

c) With mu at one, both Propositions 4.3.8 and 4.3.9 become important with the Lagrange equation. A term without a coefficient needs specific function-types for the Lagrange's convergence. 



Rules:  Proposition 4.3.5 (Fritz John Necessary Condition):
         When mu*delf(x*)+sum[lambda**h(x*)] + sum[mu**delg(x*)] = 0
              mu>=0
              mu or lambda != 0
         In every region by x*, lambda**h(x)>0, mu*g(x)>0 and f(x)<f(x*)

        Proposition 4.3.8 (Linear Independence/Interior Point Constrain Qualification:
         When delh(x)*d=0 and delg(x*)*d<0
         The solution is x*

        Proposition 4.3.9 (Slater Constraint Qualification for Convex Inequalities):
         When h(x) is linear, but g(x) convex
         g(x) < 0 for some case
         The solution becomes x*
