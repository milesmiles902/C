Question 2.4.1

Function: f(x) = (1/2)*||g(x)||^2 
               = (1/2)*sum_i_m[||g_i(x)||^2]

Subject to: x ∈ Rⁿ

a) When g(x*) = 0, an optimal solution x* is singular for the Hessian Matrix:
   
        H = ∂/∂x[∂/∂x((1/2)*||g(x)||^2)]
          = 0

b) When g becomes linear in the form g(x) = z-Ax, then infinite optimal solutions satisfy g(x).
        
        g(x*) = g(x)' 
              = 0 
              = A

   As A = 0, then any zero determinant becomes a solution.

   Also, A has linearly independent rows because the definition is solution with linearly coefficients about row or column vectors:
  
        x* = A'(A*A')^-1 is a solution.
 
        x* = a₁*v₁ + ... + an*vn is many other solutions.

Rules: Hessian Matrix:
        H=∂/∂x[∂f/∂x]
