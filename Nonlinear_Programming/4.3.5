Question 4.3.5 (Constraint Qualifications for Inequality Constraints):

Function: f(x)

Constraint: g(x) <= 0

            F(x) = {d | alpha>0, g(x+alpha*d)<=0 for all alpha }  <---Feasible directions, alpha is conditional step

a) delf(x*)*d, the derivative is greater than (or equal to) zero because a positive limit definition of a derivative.

       delf(x*)*d = lim (alpha->0) [f(x+alpha*d)-f(x)]/alpha >= 0

b) The constraint F(x) describes a feasible direction, limits a step-size, and directs the gradient toward a minumum. 
   Through Farkas Lemma, if the individal vectors are greater than zero, the sum of vectors too.

         delf(x*)*d >= 0 

         sum [delf(x*)*d ] >= 0
     
   With the secondary constraint, if the individual vectors are less than zero, the sum of the vectors too.

         delg(x*)*d <= 0 

         sum [g(x*)*d] <= 0

   The Lagrange equation comes from the above inequalities:

         -sum [delf(x*)*d ] =  mu*sum [g(x*)*d] where mu>=0

          sum [delf(x*)*d ] + mu*sum [g(x*)*d] = 0

c) 1/2) Part b holds because delg(x*)*d <= 0, as in the second step. 

         Step #1: g(x) = g(x_1 + alpha*d)

         Step #2: g(x) = g(x_2 + alpha*d)

         Step #n: g(x) = g(x_n + alpha*d)

         The steps show linearity.
    
         At a minimum: g(x*) = g(x* + alpha*d)

                             = g(x*) + alpha*d

                             = 0 at a minimum

         Therefore, alpha = -g(x*)/d

                          >= 0 because constraint F(x)

                    g(x) <= 0

         delg(x*)*d <= 0 

    3) g(x)<0, fits the previous two lines.

    4) A linear independence for delg(x*) requires g(x) = g(x_n+alpha*d) be independent. When the equations expands,          

         g(x) = g(x_n+alpha*d)

              = g(x_n) + alpha*d

         Any set of real numbers for d is indepdendent and g(x) too.

d) New function: f(x1,x2) = x1 + x2
 
   Constraints: g1(x1,x2) = | -x1^2+x2 if x1>=0
                            | -x1^4+x2 if x1<=0

                g2(x1,x2) = | x1^4-x2 if x1>=0
                            | x1^2-x2 if x1<=0

   The Lagrange equation: L(x1,x2,lambda,mu,eta) = lambda*f(x1,x2) + mu*g1(x1,x2) + eta*g2(x1,x2)

   An evaluation at x*=(0,0) by plugging-in the value into L(x1*,x2*,lambda,mu,eta) = 0.

   Variables lambda, mu, and eta are difficult in resolution because symmetry. 

e) New function: f(x)
   
   Constraint: delf(x*) != 0 

   An argument from part d is unresolvable Lagrange multipliers because symmetry.

Rules: Farkas Lemma (Directions in a gradient)
         If c is the sum of vectors
         Such that c*y<=0 
         Nonnegative scalars approximate, c=mu*a+...+mu*a
