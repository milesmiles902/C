Question 4.3.5 (Constraint Qualifications for Inequality Constraints):

Function: f(x)

Constraint: g(x) <= 0

            F(x) = {d | alpha>0, g(x+alpha*d)<=0 for all alpha }  <---Feasible directions, alpha is conditional step

a) delf(x*)*d, the derivative is greater than (or equal to) zero because a positive limit definition of a derivative.

       delf(x*)*d = lim (alpha->0) [f(x+alpha*d)-f(x)]/alpha >= 0

b) The constraint F(x) describes a feasible direction, limits a step-size, and directs the gradient toward a minumum. 
   Through Farkas Lemma, if the individal vectors are greater than zero, the sum of vectors too.

         delf(x*)*d >= 0 

         sum [delf(x*)*d ] >= 0
     
   With the secondary constraint, if the individual vectors are less than zero, the sum of the vectors too.

         delg(x*)*d <= 0 

         sum [g(x*)*d] <= 0

   The Lagrange equation comes from equating the two inequalities above:

         -sum [delf(x*)*d ] =  mu*sum [g(x*)*d] where mu>=0

          sum [delf(x*)*d ] + mu*sum [g(x*)*d] = 0

c) ....

Rules: Farkas Lemma (Directions in a gradient)
         If c is the sum of vectors
         Such that c*y<=0 
         Nonnegative scalars approximate, c=mu*a+...+mu*a
