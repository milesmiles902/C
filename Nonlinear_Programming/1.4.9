Question 1.4.8 (Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Convergence of Iterative Methods for Linear Equations)

Function: x^{k+1} = x^k - alpha*D*(Ax^k-b) 
            where D[nxn], b[nx1], and with a single-valued soluion
          
I) Each eigenvalue pf DA either has a positive real part of is equal to 0

          If D = | 0 N | and A = | U V |, where N = U*DA*V and H = V*DA*V
                 | 0 H |

          Then, DA = [UV]| 0 N |[U V]' when UV is the lower and VU an upper diagnol matrix, also an orthonormal basis
                         | 0 H |

          So, x^{k+1} = x^k - alpha*D*r, where r = AX-b = AVz for a complete function.

          Two equations appear from the original equation by substitution of a matrix:
     
              x^{k+1} = x^k - alpha*N*z   and   x^{k+1} = x^k - alpha*H*z 

          The two derived equations symbolize separate convergences about individual eigenvalues. 

          Section 1.3: Rates of convergence bounds eigenvalues by small (a) and large(b), min{2a/(a^2+b^2)}. The interval of eigenvalues becomes 0 to 2a/(a^2+b^2):

              0 < eigenvalue < 2a/(a^2+b^2)

          When rearranged about a finite boundary and unit circle: 

              |1-eigenvalue(a+b*i)| < 1

          The normal bound is a convergent series for one of the two equations above.

II) The dimension of the nullspace of DA is equal to the multiplicity of the 0 eigenvalue of DA

          The eigenvalues of D = | 0 N | describe the nullspace of DA.
                                 | 0 H |
        
          Further, DA = (D-lambda)A = (D-lambda) = | -lambda      N    | = (-lambda)(H-lambda) = lambda^2-H*lambda = 0
                                                   |    0     H-lambda |
          Real and imaginary eigenvalues show multiplicity, say multiplicity 2 for a two by two matrix, also the nullspace.
         
          When the multiplicity of the eigenvalue and DA's nullspace are zero, then lambda = 0;               


III) The nullspace of A is equal to the nullspace of DA

         A zero property defined in multiplcation. Eigenvalues for a matrix equal the nullspace across multiplication. 

Rules: Newton's Method: 
        x^{k+1} = x^k - delf(x)/del[delf(x)]
