Question 2.1.5 (Conjugate Gradient Method by Extrapolation)

Function: f(x) = (1/2)*x'*Q*x - b'*x

Method: x^{k+1} = x^k - alpha^k*g^k + beta^k*(x^k-x^{k-1})

Manifold: x^k + (subspace spanned by g^k and x^k - x^{k-1})

If g^k is the beta term in the Heavy Step Method, then the last term is similar to Newton's method.

In the analogy above, the span or manifold in the Heavy Step is equal to Newton's Method:

         x^k + (subspace spanned by g^k and x^k - x^{k-1}) = span {d^{k-1} + d^k}

Also, a similar span found in Question 2.1.4, which is the Conjugate Gradient Method.


Rules: Conjugate Gradient Method: 
         d*Q*d = 0
         d = alpha*d + ... + alpha^{k-1}*d^{k-1}
         d*Q*d = alpha*d + ... + alpha^{k-1}*d^{k-1} = 0
         A successive iterate minimizes the function over a progressibly expanding linear manifold.
 
       Newton's Method: 
         x^{k+1} = x^k - alpha^k*d^k
