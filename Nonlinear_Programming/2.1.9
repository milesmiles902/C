Question 2.1.9

Supposition: d^0,...,d^k are Q-conjugate directions.
             x^0,...,x^k are corresponding conjugate vectors
             x^{i+1} != x^i for i=0,...,k


a) Show d^{k+1} is Q-conjugate to the directions, if not equal to zero. 

   The vector v = |x^0| generates a quadratic function: (1/2)*v'*Q*v - b'*x 
                  |x^1|
                  |...|
                  |x^k|

   A conjugate gradient method's minimal solution is not a derivative, but a system of equations:
 
         v'Q*v - b'*v = 0
 
               is 

        | x^1*Q*v - b'v | = |0|
        |               |   | |
        | x^2*Q*v - b'v | = |0|
        |               |   |.|
        |      ...      |   |.|
        |               |   |.|
        | x^k*Q*v - b'v | = |0|

   Each of the terms in a conjugate gradient method, d*Q*d or d*Q*v, equal zero.

          x^1*Q*v = 0
          x^2*Q*v = 0
            ...
          x^k*Q*v = 0

   These steps show an additional step, x^{k+1}, or otherwise, d^{k+1}, orthogonal vector set.

b)Show d^{k+1} is orthogonal to the gradient differences g^{i+1}-g^i

   The vector v = |x^0| generates a quadratic function: (1/2)*v'*Q*v - b'*x
                  |x^1|
                  |...|
                  |x^k|

   A conjugate gradient method's minimal solution is not a derivative, but a system of equations:

         v'Q*v - b'*v = 0
 
               is

        | x^1*Q*v - b'v | = |0|
        |               |   | |
        | x^2*Q*v - b'v | = |0|
        |               |   |.|
        |      ...      |   |.|
        |               |   |.|
        | x^k*Q*v - b'v | = |0|

   Each of the terms in a conjugate gradient method, d*Q*d or d*Q*v, equal zero.

          x^1*Q*v = 0
          x^2*Q*v = 0
            ...
          x^k*Q*v = 0

   A orthogonal solution appears through row by row subtraction.
 
         (x^1-x^2)'*Q*v = 0
         (x^2-x^3)'*Q*v = 0
            ...
         (x^k-x^{k-1})'*Q*v = 0

   These steps show an additional step, x^{k+1}, or otherwise, d^{k+1}, orthogonal vector subtraction.

 Gradient Method: 
         d*Q*d = 0
         d = alpha*d + ... + alpha^{k-1}*d^{k-1}
         d*Q*d = alpha*d + ... + alpha^{k-1}*d^{k-1} = 0
         A successive iterate minimizes the function over a progressibly expanding linear manifold.
