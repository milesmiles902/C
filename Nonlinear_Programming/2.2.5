Question 2.2.5

Function x^{k+1} = x^k - alpha^k*D^k*delf(x^k)

Condition Number: R^k = Q^(1/2)*D^k*Q^(1/2)

a) Supposition: lambda1 <= .... <= lambdaN
                
   The eigenvalues of R^{k+1} contain R^k's eigenvalues:

   When r^k = Q^{1/2}*p^k and q^k = Q^{1/2}*r, both equations reduce Davidson-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) Method. The equation contains ratios of like-terms because non-symmetric matrices.

   D^{k+1} = D^k + p^k*p^k'/p^k'*q^k - D^k*q^k*q^k'*D^k/(q^k'*D^k*q^k)

           = D^k + r^k*r^k'/r^k'Q*r^k - D^k*Q^{1/2}*r^k*Q^{1/2}*r^k'*D^k/(r^k*Q^{1/2}*D^k*Q^{1/2}*r^k)

   The condition number, R requires Q^{1/2}*D^k*Q^{1/2}:

   Q^{1/2}*D^{k+1}*Q^{1/2} = Q^{1/2}*D^kQ^{1/2} + Q^{1/2}*r^k*r^k'*Q^{1/2}/r^k'Q*r^k - Q^{1/2}*D^k*Q^{1/2}*r^k*Q^{1/2}*r^k'*D^k*Q^{1/2}/(r^k*Q^{1/2}*D^k*Q^{1/2}*r^k)
 
   R^{k+1} = R^k + r^k*r^k'/r^k'*r^k - R^k*r^k*r^k'*R^k/(r^k'*R*r^k)

   Each term from R^{k+1} above has eigenvalues:
   
             R^k = Eigenvalues A

             r^k*r^k'/r^k'*r^k = Eigenvalues B
 
             R^k*r^k*r^k'*R^k/(r^k'*R*r^k) = Eigenvalues C

   The second termm shows R^{k+1} = 1 and an eigenvalue of one.

   An eigenvalue is zero because the polynomial in the third term.

   Eigenvalue solutions come from a matrix or term-by-term comparison.

b) Equation 2.58 scales the initial step, D^0. An equivalent relationship is r^0'*r^0/r^0'*R*r^0 with a value of one. The scaling law fits the second term's eigenvalue at one. Numerical iteration models a polynomial and matrix mixture before the final solution for pre-defined eigenvalues in small terms. 

c) The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarm-Shanno method updates:

   D^{k+1} = D^k + p^k*p^k'/p^k'*q^k - (D^k*q^k*q^k'*D^k)/(q^k'*D^k*q^k) + (eta*tau*v*v')^k

           = R^k + (1+r^k'*R*r^k/r^k'r^k)r^k*r^k'/r^k'*r^k - R^k*r^k*r^k'*R^k/(r^k'*R*r^k)

Rules: Davidson-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) Method
        D^{k+1} = D^k + p^k*p^k'/p^k'*q^k - (D^k*q^k*q^k'*D^k)/(q^k'*D^k*q^k)
 
       Proposition A.18(d): lim(k->inf) A^k = 0

       Scaling (Equation 2.58):
        ~D^0 = [p^0'*q^0/(q^0'*D^0*q^0)]*D^0
             = constant*D^0

       Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarm-Shanno (BFGS) Method
        D^{k+1} = D^k + p^k*p^k'/p^k'*q^k - (D^k*q^k*q^k'*D^k)/(q^k'*D^k*q^k) + (eta*tau*v*v')^k
