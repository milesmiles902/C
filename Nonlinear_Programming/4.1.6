Question 4.1.6 (Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality):

Function: alpha1*x1 + alpha2*x2 +...+ alpha_n*x_n

Constraint: x1^{alpha1}*x2^{alpha2}*...*x_n^{alpha_n} =1,  xi>0, i=1,...,n

            sum[alpha_i] = 1

The arithmetic-geometric mean equation is an induction prof with Jensen Inequality and phi(x)=ln(x):

       Base Case: 

          ln[x1^{alpha1}] <= ln[alpha_i*x*i]
          alpha1*ln[x1] <= ln[alpha_i*x_i]

       Inductive Hypothesis: 

          sum[alpha_i*ln[x_i]] <= sum[ln[alpha_i*x_i]]

       Inductive Step/Proof: 

          sum[alpha_{i+1}*ln[x_{i+1}] <= sum[ln[alpha_{i+1}*x_{i+1}]]

          alpha1*ln[x1]+alpha2*ln[x2] <= ln[alpha1*x1+alpha2*x2]


        Another method toward a proof is by graphical methods.

Rules: Jensen Inequality
         phi(sum[ x ]) <= sum[ phi(x) ]
