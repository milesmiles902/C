Question 3.3.5:

a) The feasible descent direction when x^k is nonstationary:

    ||x^{k+1}-x*|| <= ||(x^k-s*delf(x^k)) - (x*-s*delf(x*))||

                      <= ||xbar^{k+1} - xbar^k||

                      <= 0

       ||xbar^{k+1}|| <= ||xbar^k||

       || argmin{ f(x^{k+1})*(x-x^{k+1}) + (x-x^{k+1})*H^{k+1}*(x-x^{k+1})/(2s^{k+1})} } || <= ||argmin{ f(x^k)*(x-x^k) + (x-x^k)*H^k*(x-x^k)/(2s^k)} }||

       || f(x^{k+1})*(x-x^{k+1}) || <= ||f(x^k)*(x-x^k)||

b) Every limit point of a sequence {x^k} generated by the method is stationary:

      A stationary point: 
 
           lim(k->inf) ||xbar^k-x^k|| < infinity
          
           lim(k->inf) f(x^k)(xbar^k-x^k) < 0 

       In Equation 3.61, the coefficient alpha^k brings the function toward a stationary point by Armijo's rule in Proposition 3.3.1. Also, Prop 3.3.1 fits every point in a sequence as a stationary point.


c) Equation (3.46) holds sufficiently near the minimum x~=x*.

      ||x^{k+1}-x*|| <= ||(x^k-s*delf(x^k)) - (x*-s*delf(x*))||

                      <= ||xbar^{k+1} - xbar^k||

                      <= 0

       ||xbar^{k+1}|| <= ||xbar^k||

       || argmin{ f(x^{k+1})*(x-x^{k+1}) + (x-x^{k+1})*H^{k+1}*(x-x^{k+1})/(2s^{k+1})} } || <= ||argmin{ f(x^k)*(x-x^k) + (x-x^k)*H^k*(x-x^k)/(2s^k)} }||

       || f(x^{k+1})*(x-x^{k+1}) || <= ||f(x^k)*(x-x^k)||



Rules: Equation 3.58: xbar^k is in the set argmin{ x-x^k }
       Equation 3.59: xbar^k = argmin { f(x)(x-x^k)+(x-x^k)*H^k*(x-x^k)/(2s^k)}
       Equation 3.60: X = { x | x = betax0+sum_0_b[gam_i*xbar^i, beta >= 0, beta+sum_0_k[gam_i]] = 1 }
       Equation 3.61: x^{k+1} = x^k + alpha^k(xbar^k-x^k)
