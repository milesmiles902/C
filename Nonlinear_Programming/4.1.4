Question 4.1.4:

A Lagrangian theorem with a linear constraint proposes second order differentiation requirements. Without a second-order space, lambda coefficient becomes zero.

Rules: Lagrange Multiplier Theorem (Regular)
         A) x* is a minimum on f
         B) h(x)=0
         C) A lambda vector weights the constraint: 
              delf(x*) + sum_1_m[ lambda_i*delh(x*)) ] = 0
         D) The function f and h are twice differentiable and continuous
              y'*( del[delf(x*)] + sum_1_m[lambda_i*del[delh(x*)]] )*y >= 0
         E) A subspace I never knew about:
              V(x*) = {y| delh(x*)*y=0, i=1,...,m}
