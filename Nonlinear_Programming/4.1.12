Question 4.1.12:

Proof by Contrapositive:

   Hypothesis: If a Lagrange multipler's value is above zero in a minimal Lagrange equation.

   Conclusion: Indefinite x-valued solutions exist too at the minimum. 

   Not-Hypothesis: If a Lagrange multiplier equals zero. The Lagrange equation is then L(x) = f(x)+lambda*g(x) = f(x). 

   Not-Conclusion: A minimal L(x) = f'(x) = f(x*) = 0 has only one solution.

   The not-hypothesis and not-conclusion are true, so by condition, hypothesis, and conclusion too.
