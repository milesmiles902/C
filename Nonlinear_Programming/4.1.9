Question 4.1.9:

a) What triangle type maximizes area when around a circumscribed circle?

   Function: Circle Area = pi*r^2 where r is radius
             Triangle Area = ro*(x+y+z) where x, y, z are triangle side lengths, ro as circle radius
                           = sqrt(xyz(x+y+z)) by Heron's Formula

   Constraint: xyz-ro^2(x+y+z)

   Lagrange Equation:
 
     L(x,y,z) = x+y+z + lambda*(xyz-ro^2(x+y+z))

     dL(x,y,z)/dx = 1+lambda(yz-ro^2)
 
                  = 0

     dL(x,y,z)/dy = 1+lambda(xz-ro^2)
 
                  = 0

     dL(x,y,z)/dz = 1+lambda(xy-ro^2)
        
                  = 0

     dL(x,y,z)/dro = lambda(2*ro(x+y+z))

                   = 0

     dL(x,y,z)/dlambda = (xyz-ro^2(x+y+z)
              
                       = 0

     1+lambda(yz-ro^2) = 1+lambda(xz-ro^2) = 1+lambda(xy-ro^2) = lambda(2*ro(x+y+z)) = (xyz-ro^2(x+y+z)

     Five equations with five unknowns (x,y,z,lambda,ro) equate x=y=z for a positive ro. 

     The triangle type is an equilateral because the same length sides.

b) What points on a unit circle intersect an inner triangle with maximal area?

     Function:
