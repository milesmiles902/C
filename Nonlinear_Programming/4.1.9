Question 4.1.9:

a) What triangle type maximizes area when around a circumscribed circle?

   Function: Circle Area = pi*r^2 where r is radius
             Triangle Area = ro*(x+y+z) where x, y, z are triangle side lengths, ro as semi-perimeter
                           = sqrt(xyz(x+y+z)) by Heron's Formula

   Constraint: xyz = ro^2(x+y+z)

   Lagrange Equation:
 
     L(x,y,z) = x+y+z + lambda*(xyz-ro^2(x+y+z))

     dL(x,y,z)/dx = 1+lambda(yz-ro^2)
 
                  = 0

     dL(x,y,z)/dy = 1+lambda(xz-ro^2)
 
                  = 0

     dL(x,y,z)/dz = 1+lambda(xy-ro^2)
        
                  = 0

     dL(x,y,z)/dro = lambda(2*ro(x+y+z))

                   = 0

     dL(x,y,z)/dlambda = (xyz-ro^2(x+y+z)
              
                       = 0

     1+lambda(yz-ro^2) = 1+lambda(xz-ro^2) = 1+lambda(xy-ro^2) = lambda(2*ro(x+y+z)) = (xyz-ro^2(x+y+z)

     Five equations with five unknowns (x,y,z,lambda,ro) equate x=y=z for a positive ro. 

     The triangle type is an equilateral because the same length sides.

b) What points on a unit circle intersect an inner triangle with maximal area?

     Function: f(x,y,a,b) = (x-a)(x-a)+(y-b)(y-b) where x and y are points on the unit circle, while a and b, respective shifts

     Constraint: 1 = x*x+y*y 

     Lagrange Equation:

       L(x,y,a,b) = (x-a)*(x-a)+(y-b)(y-b)+lambda(1-x*x+y*y)

              dL(x,y,a,b)/dx = -2a-2(lambda-1)x

                      = 0

       dL(x,y,a,b)/dy = -2b-2(lambda-1)y

                      = 0

       dL(x,y,a,b)/da = 2(a-x)

                      = 0

       dL(x,y,a,b)/db = 2(b-y)

                      = 0

       dL(x,y,a,b)/dlambda = (1-x*x-y*y)

                           = 0

       Five equations with five unknowns (x,y,a,b,lambda) equate x=y and b=a with lambda!=0.

       The triangle type connects a line through the circle center. A sample coordinate <(x-a),(y-b)> on a unit circle is pi/3 radians, along with the triangle angle across the center.

c) What is the inscribed triangle in a given circle? Equilateral triangle having x=y and a=b.

d) What are the properties of a rectangle in a unit circle?

        Function: f(a,b) = a*a+b*b where a and b are quadrilateral side lengths

        Constraint: Area = a*b

        Lagrange Equation:

           L(a,b) = a*a+b*b + lambda*a*b

           dL(a,b)/da = 2a+lambda

                      = 0

           dL(a,b)/db = 2b+lambda

                      = 0

           dL(a,b)/dlambda = a*b

                           = 0

        The solution equates side lengths, a=b and lambda as (a-2)a. It's a square.
