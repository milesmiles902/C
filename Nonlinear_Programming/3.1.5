Question 3.1.5:

Function: (Surface Area Pyramid) = (1/2)*sum_1_3[a_i*x_i]

Costraint: Constant = sum_1_3 [a_i*x_i]; where x_i = {x|x>=0, sum_i [x_i] = constant} <--simplex

The minimal surface area governed by a constraint distance:
   
  SA = (1/2)*sum_1_3[a_i*x_i]

  dSA/da_i = d/da_i [(1/2)*sum_1_3[a_i*x_i]]
 
           = (1/2)*sum_1_3[x_i]

           = 0

      x_i* = 0

Therefore, the x_i distances are a constant and similar distances.
