Question 3.2.9 (Min-H Method for Optimal Control)

Sequence: u = (u0, u1, ... , u_{n-1})
          x = (x1, x2, ... , x_N)

Function: g_N(x_N) + sum_0_{N-1}[g_i(x_i,u_i]]

Constraint: u_i predefines a set
            x_{i+1} = phi_i(x_i) + B_i*u_i
 
Sequence generation: u_i^{k+1} = u_i^k + alpha^k(u_i^k-y_i^k)

Subset: u_i^k = argmin H_i(x_i^k, u_i, p_{i+1}^k)

        with H_i(x_i, u_i, p_{i+1}) = g_i(x_i,u_i) + p'_{i+1}*f_i(x_i, u_i)

The feasible direction method:

Rules:  Armijo Rule (Successive reduction rule)
         f(x^k)-f(x^k+(b^m)*s*(d^k))>=-sigma*(b^m)*s*delf(x*)'*(d^k)
         Reduction factor: b
         Step sizes: (b^m)*s
         Scaling factor: (d^k)
         Trials: m
         Change of the Quadratic Interpolation: delf(x*)'*(d^k)

        Line Minimization Rule:       |    0     |
                                      |    .     |
                                      |    0     |
                              d^k = - |df(x^k)/dx|
                                      |    0     |
                                      |    .     |
                                      |    0     |
