Question 2.1 

Gram-Schmidt Properties (Figure 2.1.2):

When c and E^{0} = d^{0}, then E^{1} = E{0} - c and d^{1} = E^{1} + c. 

The problem displays a projection about a vector onto another axes.

Simarly, when d, f and E^{1} = d^{1}+f^{1}, then E^{2} = E^{1} + d^{1} + f^{1}.

The projection of a vector onto less axes is intuitive for a human, a shadow onto a plane, three onto two dimensions. Rather, the projection of a vector on increased axes is less intuitive, and the problem's solution.
