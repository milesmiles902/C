Question 4.1.5:

Constraints: lambda1 = min { x'*Q*x }
             eta1 is an element in argmin { x'*Q*x }

             lambda_{i+1} = min { x'*Q*x }
             eta_{i+1} is an element of argmin { x'*Q*x }

a) Why is lambda1 <= lambda2 <= .... <= lambdaN?

     The distributed matrix: x'*Q*x + sum_i_n[ (lambda_i*h(x))^i ]

     An eigenvalue rank when asymptotically convergent approximates a largest eigenvalue as the greatest magnitude and lowest normal error. A Lagrangian in a matrix expansion is a polynomial, as with eigenvalues. eta's computation fits an eigenvalue in this model. When in an ordered set, each transformation process describes the dominant components, processes, geometry, or normal error. 

b) Why is eta linearly independent?
  
     The eigenvalue (eta) transforms a matrix into eigenvectors (e1,...,en). The rows and columns after transformation are already linearly independent. A confirmation about linear independence involves a matrix reduction till no possible row or column operations that summate to zero. Another confirmation about linear indendence for symmetric matrices evaluates the determinant as non-zero.

c) Interpret Lagrange multipliers as eigenvalues of Q, while e1,....,en, the eigenvectors:

     In a nonlinear constraint situation, a Lagrange multiplier generates eigenvectors. The Lagrange multipler with a nonlinear constraint is an nth-ordered polynomial and matrix, so Lagrange multipliers synonomize eigenvalues.
