Question 4.1.5:

Constraints: lambda1 = min { x'*Q*x }
             eta1 is an element in argmin { x'*Q*x }

             lambda_{i+1} = min { x'*Q*x }
             eta_{i+1} is an element of argmin { x'*Q*x }

a) Why is lambda1 <= lambda2 <= .... <= lambdaN?

     The Lagrangian equation: x'*Q*x + sum_i_n[ (lambda_i*h(x))^i ]

     eta's computation fits an eigenvalue. The eigenvalue dominance or rank when asymptotically convergent approximates the largest eigenvalue as lowest normal error. A Lagrangian system in a matrix expansion is a polynomial, as with eigenvalues. Each decomposition process when in order describe dominant components, processes, geometry, and normal error. 

b) Why is eta linearly indepdendent?
