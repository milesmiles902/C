Question 3.6.2 (Linear Convergence of Incremental Aggregated Proximal Algorithm):

Algorithm 3.120: x^{k+1} = argmin { f(x) + sum[f(x)(x-x^k)]+(x-x^k)/(2alpha^k)  }

When the function is near a minimum:

                 x^{k+1} = argmin { f(x) + sum[f(x)(x-x^k)]+(x-x^k)/(2alpha^k)  }

                 f_i(x) = f(x) + sum[f(x)(x-x^k)]

                 A linearization coincides with the proximal minimization.

                 where z^k = x^k-alpha^k*sum[delf_i(x)]

                 x^{k+1} = argmin { f_i(x) + (x-z^k)/(2alpha^k)  }

The function in the line above approximates steps with an inner gradient store.
