Question 1.4.10 (Iterative Solutions of Nonlinear Equations)

Function: x^{k+1} = x^k - D^k*g(x^k)

Solution: g(x) = 0

a) (linear convergence)

  Suppose, L = lim(k->inf) sup||I-D^k*delg(x*)'||

  If L < 1, then:
         
           lim(k->inf) sup||I-D^k*delg(x*)'|| < 1
 
           lim(k->inf) 1/D^k = delg(x*) = 0

  A nonlinear (or simultaneous) system of equations converge with am increasingly small step-size or zero derivative. 
b) (local convergence)

  Suppose, lim(x->x*) ||1 - D(x)*delg(x*)'|| < 1

  A shift (b) applied to the equation:

           lim(x->x*) 1/D(x) < delg(x*)
        
           lim(x->x*) 1/D(x-b) < delg(x*-b)

  A nonlinear (or simultaneous) system of equations converge at an integer no matter the case because translation about the input.
