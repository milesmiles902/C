Question 4.3.9:

Function: f(x)

Constraint: h(x*)=0

Lagrange equation: L(x*,lambda,mu) = lambda*f(x*) + mu*h(x*) = 0

A derivative shows delf(x*) = 0, specifically, dL(x*,lambda,mu)/dx = lambda*delf(x*)+mu*delh(x*) = 0
 
                                                          delf(x*) = -mu*delh(x*)/lambda = 0

Rules: Proposition 4.3.17 (Fritz John condition):
         In the case, min{f(x)}
         subject to h(x)=0 and g(x)<=0
         Then coefficients are possible factors, such as lambda and mu.
