Question 1.3.6 (Convergence Rate Characterizations)

a) A convergence by limit (k->inf) for faster than linearly with convergence ratio beta

   A convergence by limit (k->inf) for slower than linearly with convergence ratio beta

   A convergence by limit (k->inf) equal to linear with convergence ratio beta


Conditions: Converges faster than linearly with convergence ratio beta: e^k <= q*beta^k
  
            Converges slower than linearly with convergence ratio beta: q*beta^k <= e^k

            Converges linearly with convergence ratio beta: e^k = q*beta^k
