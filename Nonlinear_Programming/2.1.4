Question 2.1.4

Function: f(x) = (1/2)*x'*Q*x - b'x    where Q is positive definite and symmetric

A minimizes f(x):
         
          f'(x) = x'*Q - b

The conjugate gradient method expands the function and function's derivative.




Rules: Conjugate Gradient Method: 
         d*Q*d = 0
         d = alpha*d + ... + alpha^{k-1}*d^{k-1}
         d*Q*d = alpha*d + ... + alpha^{k-1}*d^{k-1} = 0
         A successive iterate minimizes the function over a progressibly expanding linear manifold.
