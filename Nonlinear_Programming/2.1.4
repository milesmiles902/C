Question 2.1.4

Function: f(x) = (1/2)*x'*Q*x - b'x    where Q is positive definite and symmetric

A minimizes f(x):
         
          f'(x) = x'*Q - b

The conjugate gradient method expands the function and function's derivative.

          f'(x) = (x^0+sum_0_k-1 [Q*delf(x^0)])*Q - b 
 
                = (x^0)*Q - b + sum_0_k-1 [Q*delf(x^0)]
 
                where (x^0)*Q - b is the first term of the conjugate gradient method 

By example, successive terms from the expansion show term two, three, and up to k-1.

The first inductive step remains for each step till k-1 and the subspace span:

          x^0 + (subspace spanned by g^0, Qg^0, ... , Q^{k-1}*g^0)

Rules: Conjugate Gradient Method: 
         d*Q*d = 0
         d = alpha*d + ... + alpha^{k-1}*d^{k-1}
         d*Q*d = alpha*d + ... + alpha^{k-1}*d^{k-1} = 0
         A successive iterate minimizes the function over a progressibly expanding linear manifold.
