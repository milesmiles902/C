Question 4.1.7:

Function: sum_1_m[ ||x-a||^2 ]

ConstraintL ||x||^2 = 1

What is the unique maximum and minimum by Lagrangian? 

  f(x,a) = sum_1_m[ ||x-a||^2 ] + lambda*(1-||x||^2)

  df(x,a)/dx = 2*sum_1_m[ ||x-a|| ] - 2*lambda*||x||

             = 0

  lambda* = sum_1_m[ ||x-a|| ]/||x||    

          = m-sum_1_m[ a ]

  The functions maximum or minimum is f(x,a,lambda*) = sum_1_m[ ||x-a||^2 ] + (m-sum_1_m[ a ])*(1-||x||^2).

  The multi-variable function's minimum is when a<m and maximum when a>m. This is a saddle-node bifurcation.  

What happens when a=0 for a Lagrangian equation?

    When a = 0 at function's turning point, f(x,a=0,lambda*) = m. This is a half-stable or saddle-point in asymptotic math.
