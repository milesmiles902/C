Question 1.1.5

Function for a rectangular parallelpiped of unit volume: V=l*w*h;
Function for surface area of a rectangular pallelpiped: SA = 2lw+2lh+2wh;

Global Minimum Surface Area: dSA/dl = 2w+2h+2wh;
                                    = w(1+h)+h 
                                    = 0
                                  w = -(1+h)/h
                            (l,w,h) = (l,-(1+h)/h, h)

An equivalent problem: If l=w, then SA = 2w*w+2w*h+2w*h 
                                  SA/2 = w*w+w*h+w*h
                            d(SA/2)/dw = 2w+2h
                                       = 0
                                     w = h    
                       f(x,y) = x*y+1/y+1/x has minima equivalent when x=1/sqrt(y)
  
Compact set: A bounded solution to f(x,y) has positive and definite scalars, x and y, also known as lengths.
