Question 1.2.8

Function: x^{k+1} = x^k+(alpha*d)^k

Every limit point of {x^k} is stationary: 

                                          x^{k+1} = x^k + alpha^k*d^k
                                              x^k = x^k-1 + alpha^{k-1}*d^{k-1}       
                          If k=1, then        x   = 1 + 1*df(1)/dx

Evaluating the derivative of x              dx/dx = 0
