Question 4.1.2 (Fermat's Principle in Optics):

Function: A plane described by h(x) = 0
          h is real
 
Constraint: Euclidean Distance = g(x,y,z) = ||y-x|| + ||z-x||

What are the angles in Figure 4.1.5?

  If g(x,y,z) = 0 at x*, then ||y-x*|| = -||z-x||.
  
  Equation about symmetrical and/or reflected angles: ||y-x||*sin(phi1) = ||z-x||*sin(phi2)

  So, -||y-x*||/||z-x*|| = sin(phi2)/sin(phi1), and phi1 = phi2.
