Question 3.3.8 (Projected Contractive Iterations)

Function: x^{k+1} = [g(x^k)]+, k=0,1,...

Constraints:   H is positive definite (nxn)
             ||.||n denotes the norm sqrt(zHz)
             g is real map of modulus beta (0,1)

a) If x^{k+1} = [g(x^k)]+
       
           = sqrt[g(x^k)]
       
           = sqrt[g(x^k,beta)]

b) I skipped the problem.
