Question 3.1.22: (Linear Transformations of Closed Sets)

Function: S is a nonempty and real set.

          A is a mxn matrix with each possible iteration

Show A*S is a closed set:

       X = {x|x<gamma} 

       S = {X|f(x)<gamma}

       S is nonempty set...it has f(x) values. The gamma relates to countable or a finite set.

       W = {z| ||z-Ax||<=||AS-Ax|| }

         = {z| ||z||<=||AS|| }

         = {z| ||z/A|| <= ||S|| }

       With S as a bound, then A is closed. Also, the set AS is closed.

Rules: Proposition 3.1.2:                                                                                            
         S^k is a sequence                                                                                           
         S^{k+1} is a subset of S^k                                                                                  
         S^k is nonempty
