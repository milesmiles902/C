Question 3.7.4 (Block Coordinate Descent with Nondifferentiable Terms): 

An extension about the block coordinate descent would contain a vector set at each element index. 

Normal Block Coordinate Descent Method:
         argmin{ f(x) + (1/2c)||x-y||^2 }
         subject to: x subset to X, y is a real subset

The common function from Proposition 3.7.1: f(x1, ..., x_{i-1}, eta, x_{i+1}, ..., xm).

Extended function with each element replaced by a vector: f(x) = | x1A, x2A,...,eta,x_{i-1}A,...,xmA |
                                                                 | x1B, x2B,...,eta,x_{i-1}B,...,xmB |
                                                                 |              .                    |
                                                                 |              .                    |
                                                                 |              .                    |
                                                                 | x1N, x2N,...,eta,x_{i-1}N,...,xmN | (Nxm)

Rules:  Proposition 3.7.1 (Convergence of Block Coordinate Descent):
         i) f is continously differentiable in set X
         ii) The function has a unique minimum over X: f(x1, ..., x_{i-1}, eta, x_{i+1}, ..., xm)
         iii) X changes little (monotonically nonincreasing)
         iv) Every point of X is stationary
