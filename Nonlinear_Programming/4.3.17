Question 4.3.17 (Feasible Directions for Infinitely Many Constraints):

Function: X = { x | g(x)<=0}

Constraint: g(x) is a Euclidean space
 
            A(x*) = { j | g(x) = 0}

            y is a vector, such that delg(x*)y < 0

A proof about feasible directions being the tangent cone:

    A tangent cone requires a coefficent (or multiplier) onto a function. A steepest descent method, x_k = x_{k-1} + alpha(delf(x)) has a constant coefficent alpha for derivation. An adjustment of steepest descent x_k-x_{k-1} = alpha*(delf(x)) with x_k-x_{k-1} in the range of function X, the tangent multiplier alpha, and delf(x) as the tangent.
