Question 4.3.10 (Relation of Fritz John and KKT multipliers)

Function: f(x)

Constraint: h(x) = 0
 
            g(x) <= 0

a) The Fritz John condition applies little because the minimum at zero in a Lagrange equation. Proposition 4.3.5 is helpful in cases of irregular minimum, choppy, or jagged iteration.

b) mu*delf(x*)+sum[lambda**h(x*)] + sum[mu**delg(x*)] = 0, and when mu*=1, Fritz John conditions holds, although less important across the global landscape with other constraints. 


Rules: Proposition 4.3.1 (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Necessary Conditions):
         If x* is a local minimum
         When unique multipliers prevail
         Then dL(x*,lambda*,mu*)/dx = 0
              mu>=0
         Also, ydel[dL(x*,lambda*,mu*)/dx]y>=0
         Then also, for all y, delh(x*)y=0 and delg(x*)y = 0

       Proposition 4.3.5 (Fritz John Necessary Condition):
         When mu*delf(x*)+sum[lambda**h(x*)] + sum[mu**delg(x*)] = 0
              mu>=0
              mu or lambda != 0
         In every region by x*, lambda**h(x)>0, mu*g(x)>0 and f(x)<f(x*)
         
         --Proposition 4.3.5 is unclear. It seems be about an overcompensation near minimum, x*.
