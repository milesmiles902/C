Question 4.1.8:

Function: f(x,y,z) = sin(x)sin(y)sin(z)

Constraint: An equilaterial triangle

The function sin(x)sin(y)sin(z) is concave from [0,pi] and a Jensen inequality, such that phi()=1/3.
 
       [sin(x)+sin(y)+sin(z)]/3 <= sin([x+y+z]/3) = sqrt(3)/2

With the Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean, the conclusion became a 3D-cube for a 2D-triangle:

       sin(x)sin(y)sin(z) <= ([sin(x)+sin(y)+sin(z)]/3)^3 <= (sqrt(3)/2)^3

x equals y and z because the middle bounds require similar values. I tried the problem as a Lagrange multiplier with no success.

Rules: Jensen's Inequality:
         phi(E[x])<=E[phi(x)]

       Arithmetic Mean - Geometric mean:
         x*y*z<=[(x+y+z)/3]^3
