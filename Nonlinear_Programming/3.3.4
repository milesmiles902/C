Question 3.3.4:

Constraint s^k = s

a) The feasible descent direction when x^k is nonstationary:

       ||x^{k+1}-x*|| <= ||(x^k-s*delf(x^k)) - (x*-s*delf(x*))||
       
                      <= ||xbar^{k+1} - xbar^k||                     
               
                      <= 0
 
       ||xbar^{k+1}|| <= ||xbar^k||

       || argmin{ f(x^{k+1})*(x-x^{k+1}) + (x-x^{k+1})*H^{k+1}*(x-x^{k+1})/(2s^{k+1})} } || <= ||argmin{ f(x^k)*(x-x^k) + (x-x^k)*H^k*(x-x^k)/(2s^k)} }||
       
       || f(x^{k+1})*(x-x^{k+1}) || <= ||f(x^k)*(x-x^k)||

       The average decreases when iterating in unscaled gradient projection methods.

b) Every limit point of a sequence {x^k} generated by the method is stationary:

       


Rules: Unscaled Gradient Projection Method:

        A) Average: xbar^k = argmin{ f(x^k)*(x-x^k) + (x-x^k)*H^k*(x-x^k)/(2s^k)} }
        B) Set: X= {x| ax<=b, for all j with b-eta<=ax^k<=b }
        C) Feasible Direction: xbar^{k+1} = gamma*xbar +(1-gamma)*x^k
        D) Iterative Step: x^{k+1} = x^k + alpha^k(xbar^k-x^k)

      Proposition 3.3.1:
        If {x^k} is a sequence 
        Also, alpha^k chosen by limited minimization or Armijo's rule
        Then, every point of {x^k} is stationary
