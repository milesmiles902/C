Question 1.3.4

Function: f is twice continuously differentiable

When the function x^{k+1} = x^k +alpha^k*d^k with a nonsingular x*, delf(X^k)!=0, and d^k=d(x^k), considering:

   lim(x->x*) ||d(x) + [del[delf(x)]^-1]*delf(x)||/||delf(x)|| = 0
   
   and alpha^0=1 and sigma < 0.5

a) When an error exists greater than zero, such that ||x^0-x*|| < error, then:

   ||x^{k+1}-x*|| <= ||x-x*-del[delf(x)]^-1*delf(x)|| + ||d(x)+del[del(X)]^-1*delf(x)||
   
                  <= ||d


Rules: Armijo Rule (Successive reduction rule)
       f(x^k)-f(x^k+(b^m)*s*(d^k))>=-sigma*(b^m)*s*delf(x*)'*(d^k)
       Reduction factor: b
       Step sizes: (b^m)*s
       Scaling factor: (d^k)
       Trials: m
       Change of the Quadratic Interpolation: delf(x*)'*(d^k)
