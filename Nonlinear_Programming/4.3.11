Question 4.3.11:

Function: fx)

Constraint g(x)<=0

The coefficient mu* = 0 for a constraint satisfy Fritz John's condition. 

Fritz's necessary condition also works for mu*>0 when g(x*)=0.

Rules: Preposition 4.3.5 (Fritz John Necessary Condition):
         When mu*delf(x*)+sum[lambda**h(x*)] + sum[mu**delg(x*)] = 0
              mu>=0
              mu or lambda != 0
         In every region by x*, lambda**h(x)>0, mu*g(x)>0 and f(x)<f(x*)
