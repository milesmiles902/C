Question 2.5.2 (Counter example to Totally Asynchronous Convergence by Gradient Method)

Function: f(x) = (1/2)*x'*Q*x + b'*x

Constraint: Q = | 1+error    1          1 |
                |    1    1+error       1 |
                |    1       1    1+error |

            where 0< error < 1

A sequence of iterates generated by the algorithm in Example 2.5.1:

          f(x) = (1/2)*x'*Q*x + b'*x

          delf(x) = Q*x + b

          x^{k+1} = x^k - alpha*delf(x^k)

                  = (1-alpha*Q)*x^k - alpha*b



Rules: Gradient Method:
         x^{k+1} = x^k - alpha*delf(x^k)
