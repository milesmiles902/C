Question 3.2.6 (Zontendijk's Method of Feasible Directions):

Function: f(x) is continuously differentiable and real

Constraint: g_j(x)<=0 is convex, j=0,1,2,3,...r

Vector of errors: A(x;eta) = {j|-eta<=g_j(x)<=0}

Set of minimums: phi(x;eta)

....

A similar minimization problem:

Function: z

Constraint: A) ||d|| <= 1; 
            B) f(x)*d<=z
            C) g(x)_j*d<=z; 

A guy named Zoutendijk, a german professor, he wrote a book in 1960 about methods of feasible directions. His book describes threshold error through averaging downward new iteration errors. 

a) The author presented three lemma and a two corollary (Zoutendijk, 1960, pg. 75-76). 

   Lemma 1: A real number x is a maximum of f(x), d>0 and a vector of errors*d<=z.
   Lemma 2: The function f(x) is an arbitrary continous function with a continuous gradient vector (g_j(x)) between a convex region.
   Corollary: A bounded sequence of usable errors, if a real sequence and if, for some d>0, Lemma 1 holds a scalar coefficient before an average error.
   
b) Lemma 3: When f(x) be an arbitrary function with continuous gradient vectors (g(x)_j), a finite set of errors for every gradient descent iteration.
   Corollary: If f(x)*d<=z, g(x)_j*d<=z for every j, x^{k+1}=x^k+alpha^k*d, then an index exists.

   Lemma and Corollary statements each require a Proof. The author better described the material.
