Question 3.2.6 (Zontendijk's Method of Feasible Directions):

Function: f(x) is continuously differentiable and real

Constraint: g_j(x)<=0 is convex, j=0,1,2,3,...r

Vector of errors: A(x;eta) = {j|-eta<=g_j(x)<=0}

Set of minimums: phi(x;eta)

....

A similar minimization problem:

Function: z

Constraint: A) ||d|| <= 1; 
            B) f(x)*d<=z
            C) g(x)_j*d<=z; 

A guy named Zoutendijk, a german professor, he wrote a book in 1960 about methods of feasible directions. His book describes threshold error through averaging downward new iteration errors.
