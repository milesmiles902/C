Question 3.3.6 (Gradient Projection for Optimal Routing)

Diagonally scaled gradient projection methods restrict noise in astronomical images, in combination with the point spread function (PSF) that features two image convolution. The PSF models the objective lens's misalignment by substraction of successive image sequences and optical function. Although, the noise assumption with PSF prevails the tale of telescopic distortion. Additional methods route the telescope onto proper angles, more specifically, the scaled gradient projection method. At the time of telescopic observation, an angle adjustment and successive substraction occur in order to perfect a no noise image. The scaled gradient method averages the noise downward at each index in the region of observation.
