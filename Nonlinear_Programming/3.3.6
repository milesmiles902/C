Question 3.3.6 (Gradient Projection for Optimal Routing)

Diagonally scaled gradient projection methods restrict noise in astronomical images, in combination with the point spread function (PSF). PSF models the objective lens malignment through substraction of successive image sequences and optical impulse functions. Although, the noise assumption with PSF prevails the tale of telescopic distortion. Additional methods route the telescope onto more proper angles, specifically, the gradient projection method. At the time of observation, an angle adjustment and successive substraction occur in order to perfect a no noise image.
