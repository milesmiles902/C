Question 1.1.6

Function: f(x|y,w) = sum_1_m { w_i || x - y_i ||}

Constraint subject to: x{Rn}

a) Global Minimum: d(f(x|y,w))/dx = w_i = 0

   Mechanical Model: F_tot = sum (F_i) = 0 because a conserved system.
                     Therefore, F_tot = sum_1_4 {w_i || x-y_i || }
                                      = w1*(x1-y1)+w2*(x2-y2)+w3*(x3-y3)+w4*(x4-y4)
                                      = 0 

b) The general problem is not a unique set, but a mechanical system has a unique and minimum solution.

c) Function: f(h|w) = sum_1_m { w_i * h_i}
  
   Optimal Solution: d(f(h|w))/dh = w_i
                                  = 0
 
   The solution to potential energy is conserved.
