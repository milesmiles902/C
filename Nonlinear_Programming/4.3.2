Question 4.3.2:

Function: f(x,y) = yx

Constraint: xQx <= 1  where xQx > 0 because positive definite Q.

The optimal value is sqrt(yy/Q) not because Lagrange's equation: L(x,y,lambda) = y*x + lambda(1-xQx)

Derivatives by parameter: dL(x,y,lambda)/dx = y - 2lambda*Qx

                                            = 0

                          dL(x,y,lambda)/dy = x

                                            = 0

                          dL(x,y,lambda)/dlambda = (1-xQx)

                                                 = 0

                          Lagrange's equation has no apparent solutions.


Rayleigh-Ritz theorem is another method for eigenvalue solutions; lambda approximation.

                          xQx = x(Q*D*Q)x

                              = (xQ)*D*(Qx)
 
                              = yDy

                              = sum_1_n[ lambda_i*y_i^2 ] 

                              <= 1

                          Rayleigh-Ritz theorem supposes Qx = lambda*x.

                          1 <= xQx

                            <= x*(lambda)*x

                            <= x*x(lambda)

                            = lambda

                          lambda* = 1

                          Also, xQx = y*D*y
                                    
                                    = y*(lambda*)*y
 
                                    = y*y

                                 x* = sqrt(y*y/Q)
