Question 4.3.16:

Function: X = {x|g(x)<=0, j=1...r}

Constraint g(x) is real, concave, and differentiable over reals.

Definition: A regular function has element r with other equal elements in range, 1-r. A quasiregular function has element r with other elements in range, 1-r, possible by a multiplicative factor.

X is quasiregular because g(x)'s convexity. Together, the function and constraint satisfy Fritz John's Necessary Conditions.

Rules: Proposition 4.3.5 (Fritz John Necessary Condition):
         When mu*delf(x*)+sum[lambda**h(x*)] + sum[mu**delg(x*)] = 0
              mu>=0
              mu or lambda != 0
         In every region by x*, lambda**h(x)>0, mu*g(x)>0 and f(x)<f(x*)
