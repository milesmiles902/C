Question 1.2.2

Function: f(x) = ||x||^{2+b}

An assumption: stepsize = s = constant, and b >= 0

The steepest decent method by one iteration terminates because x* is x0. An initial conditions provides an amount of iterations from a steepest decent methods, but no conditions are in the description.

Prop 1.2.2. relates to a constant step size toward a functions minimum, and a threshold to terminate the iterative function. 


Rule:  Steepest Decent Method:
       D^k=1, k=0,1,...,
       Normalized Negative Gradient: d^k=-delf(x*)/||delf(x^k)||
       Iteration: x^{k+1} = x^k-alpha*(D^k)*delf(x^k) where d^k=-D^k*del(f^k)

       Prop 1.2.2: (Constant Stepsize)
                   e < alpha^k < (2-e)*alpha^k
                  
                   where alpha^k = |delf(x^k)'*d^k|/{L||d^k||} 
                   and e(0,1]
