Question 3.3.1 (Scaled Gradient Projection Method):

Function: f(x,s,H) = x - x^k - s^k*delf(x^k)/H^k

Constraint x is in a set, X

The positive definite matrix: xbar^k = argmin{ f(x^k)(x-x^k) + (x-x^k)*H^k*(x-x^k)/(2s^k) }

The proof xbar^k is a solution:

     argmin{f(x,s,H)^2} = argmin {||x - x^k - s^k*delf(x^k)/H^k||^2}

                        = argmin {||x-x^k||^2 - 2*s^k*f(x^k)*(x-x^k)/H^k + (s^k)^2*||delf(x^k)||^2}

The (s^k)^2*||delf(x^k||^2 term neglecting in the equation because zero evaluation. Also, a division across argmin by 2*s^k/H^k:

                        = argmin {f(x^k)*(x-x^k) + (x-x^k)*H^k*(x-x^k)}
   
Bertesekes iterated, reiterated, or collected important topics in iteration's history. 1) Lipschitz Rule 2) Armijo's Rule 3) Line Minimization 4) Global iteration and average both find stationary points. 5) A function's square also finds a stationary point.
