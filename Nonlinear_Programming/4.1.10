Question 4.1.10 (Fermat's Principle):

a) What triangle in a unit circle has maximal perimeter, and another, minimal perimeter?

   Function: 2(sin(A)+sin(B)+sin(C)) where A,B,C be angles of a triangle    (Fermats Principle)

   Constraint: pi = A+B+C  (Triangle angles)
                                                                                                          
   Lagrange Equation:

      L(A,B,C,lambda) = 2(sin(A)+sin(B)+sin(C)) + lambda(pi-A-B-C) 

      dL(A,B,C,lambda)/dA = 2cos(A)-lambda

                          = 0

      dL(A,B,C,lambda)/dB = 2cos(B)-lambda

                          = 0

      dL(A,B,C,lambda)/dC = 2cos(C)-lambda
      
                          = 0             

      dL(A,B,C,lambda)/dlambda = pi-A-B-C
      
                               = 0

      The solution angles, A = B = C equate because four equations and four unknowns with random angle A and lambda = A+2cos(A)+(4n-1)pi where n in the integers. This is an equilateral triangle. It also has the minimal and maximal perimeter with points a=(-sqrt(3)/2,1/2),b = (sqrt(3)/2,-1/2), and x=(0,1).

b) Typo, no b problemset.

c) An inner product where (x-a)(x-b) maximizes the unit circle capability is a solution with x=(a+b)/2 or an average x-value between poimts a and b.
